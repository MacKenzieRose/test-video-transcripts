[Intro]

2
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.200
Bonjour, my name is Catherine Wilkie.

3
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.130
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.250
I knew I would work in the art industry since I was really young, 

5
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.200
but the turning point, what really made me decide to start a career in graphic design, was during a trip I did in England. 

6
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.100
I had the chance to visit the London Design Museum, where I saw on one of the wall 

7
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.060
a gun and a wooden cast next to it, both created around the second world war. 

8
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.210
Design can change lives, for the better or the worst. 

9
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.150
Of course, creating a brand identity isn’t the same as designing a world-changing product, 

10
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.200
but our goal is still to have a positive impact on this world, to hopefully make it better.

11
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.200
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

12
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.300
Of all the Adobe softwares, my favorite is Photoshop. It was the first program I learned to use, before I even went into design. 

13
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.250
I draw a lot with it, I do some photo-editing, and I also recently started doing frame by frame animation as well. 

14
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:20.140
Obviously, my layout design wouldn’t be anything without InDesign, and my motion nothing without AfterEffect, so props to those as well. 

15
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.170
[What is your favourite font? What font describes your personality?]

16
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.100
I’m a type geek. I love typography: 

17
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.190
I love matching fonts, looking at their family, finicking with the kerning, 

18
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.160
making some cool title with way too many text boxes. 

19
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.270
Saying I have a favourite font would be like choosing my favorite siblings,—you can’t do that, right? 

20
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:51.020
I think there is a good font for every project, may it be sans or with serif, cursive or even papyrus!

21
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.150
Well, if I really had to choose one, just for its look, it would probably be Lust, and its amazing ampersand. 

22
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.280
Although, the font that best describes my personality would be the bold, fun, and structured Rokkitt, 

23
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.030
that you can find on my website. 

24
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.230
On this note, I hope I’ll see you there!

25
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.180
