[Intro]

2
0;00;12;150 --> 0;00;14;200
Bonjour, my name is Catherine Wilkie.

3
0;00;14;200 --> 0;00;18;130
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

4
00:00:02.200 --> 0;00;22;250
I knew I would work in the art industry since I was really young, 

5
0;00;22;250 --> 0;00;29;200
but the turning point, what really made me decide to start a career in graphic design, was during a trip I did in England. 

6
0;00;29;260 --> 0;00;34;100
I had the chance to visit the London Design Museum, where I saw on one of the wall 

7
0;00;34;100 --> 0;00;39;060
a gun and a wooden cast next to it, both created around the second world war. 

8
0;00;39;060 --> 0;00;42;210
Design can change lives, for the better or the worst. 

9
0;00;42;210 --> 0;00;47;150
Of course, creating a brand identity isn’t the same as designing a world-changing product, 

10
0;00;47;150 --> 0;00;52;200
but our goal is still to have a positive impact on this world, to hopefully make it better.

11
0;00;53;150 --> 0;00;56;200
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

12
0;00;57;220 --> 0;01;04;300
Of all the Adobe softwares, my favorite is Photoshop. It was the first program I learned to use, before I even went into design. 

13
0;01;04;320 --> 0;01;11;250
I draw a lot with it, I do some photo-editing, and I also recently started doing frame by frame animation as well. 

14
0;01;11;250 --> 0;01;20;140
Obviously, my layout design wouldn’t be anything without InDesign, and my motion nothing without AfterEffect, so props to those as well. 

15
0;01;21;190 --> 0;01;24;170
[What is your favourite font? What font describes your personality?]

16
0;01;25;130 --> 0;01;28;100
I’m a type geek. I love typography; 

17
0;01;28;100 --> 0;01;32;190
I love matching fonts, looking at their family, finicking with the kerning, 

18
0;01;32;190 --> 0;01;36;160
making some cool title with way too many text boxes. 

19
0;01;37;020 --> 0;01;42;270
Saying I have a favourite font would be like choosing my favorite siblings,—you can’t do that, right? 

20
0;01;43;290 --> 0;01;51;020
I think there is a good font for every project, may it be sans or with serif, cursive or even papyrus!

21
0;01;51;020 --> 0;01;57;150
Well, if I really had to choose one, just for its look, it would probably be Lust, and its amazing ampersand. 

22
0;01;57;150 --> 0;02;03;280
Although, the font that best describes my personality would be the bold, fun, and structured Rokkitt, 

23
0;02;03;280 --> 0;02;06;030
that you can find on my website. 

24
0;02;06;030 --> 0;02;08;230
On this note, I hope I’ll see you there!

25
0;02;09;070 --> 0;02;13;180
[Outro]
