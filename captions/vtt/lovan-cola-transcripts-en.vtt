[Intro]

2
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.290
Hi, I'm Cola Lovan. I'm a graphic designer here at Algonquin College,

3
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.240
and I'd like a little bit of your time to tell you about myself. Not right now, but now.

4
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.100
[What is your favourite colour? Pantone or Hex?] 

5
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.100  
So my favorite colour is fuchsia and not because of how it looks visually, but because of a commercial in the 1990s where 

6
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.280
a gentleman was wearing a sweater and he asked his wife, "Hey honey, what colour is this again?" 

7
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.270
And she says, "fuchsia." Honey, what's this colour called again? Fuchsia. Fuchsia. Fuchsia... 

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.100
So I was like, "Hey, that's a cool colour. That's a cool word." So, (it) just stuck in my head all the way from back then. So that's my favorite colour. 

9
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.200
It's fuchsia, for sure.

10
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.300
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]
 
11
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.130
what do I love about motion graphics? Everything. I love how it uses key frames. I love how it uses layered timelines. 

12
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:11.120
I love the effects panel. I just love how After Effects is built as an application even if it wasn't for motion. 

13
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.050
I love the plugins that After Effects has, I just love applications.

14
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.000
[What designers, brands or websites do you admire?]
So who inspires me graphic design wise?

15
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.220
[What designers, brands or websites do you admire?]
It's probably Paula Scher, and Ed Hardy for totally different reasons. 

16
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.170
[What designers, brands or websites do you admire?]
Paula Scher more for the agency style [where] she's a senior member at pentagram 

17
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.280
[What designers, brands or websites do you admire?]
and Ed Hardy because he's a tattooist that took his style to another level by cross platforming it with fashion. 

18
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.120
So, I think his innovative thinking and Paula Scher's... like, strong will, they're both traits that I really admire.

19
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.150
Graphic designer or not.
 
20
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.100
[Wood clicking noise] 

21
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.100
So what I was playing was called kendama. Is called kendama. It's a Japanese skill toy, 

22
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.280
traditional skill toy, with three cups, a spike, and a ball attached to a string. 

23
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.280
The ball has a hole in it too. Teaches you about balance and patience. 

24
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.060
Easy to learn, but of course, hard to master.

25
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.220
