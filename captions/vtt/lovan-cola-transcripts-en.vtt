[Intro]

2
00:00:12.220--> 00:00:22.140
[Hi, I'm Cola Lovan. I'm a graphic designer here at Algonquin College and I'd like a little bit of your time to tell you about myself. Not right now, but now.]

00:00:22.140--> 00:00:27.120
[What is Your Favourite Colour?] 

4
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:51.120  
[So my favorite color is fuchsia and not because of how it looks visually, but because of a commercial in the 1990s where a gentleman was wearing a sweater and he asked his wife, "Hey honey, what color is this again?" And she says, "fuchsia." Honey, what's this color called again? Fuchsia. Fuchsia. So I was like, "Hey, that's a cool color. That's a cool word." So, (it) just stuck in my head all the way from back then. So that's my favorite color. It's fuchsia, for sure.]

[What is your Favourite Subject?]
 
6
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:21.110
[So I love motion graphics. It's probably my favorite subject. Um, what do I love about motion graphics? Everything. I love how it uses key frames. I love how it uses layered timelines. I love the effects panel. I just love how After Effects is built as an application even if it wasn't for motion. I love the plugins that After Effects has, I just love applications.]

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.000
[Who Inspires You?] 

8
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:52.120
[So who inspires me graphic design wise? Its probably Paula Scher, and Ed Hardy for totally different reasons. Paula Scher more for the agency style [where] she's a senior member at pentagram and Ed Hardy because he's a tattooist that took his style to another level by cross platforming it with fashion. So, I think his innovative thinking and Paula Scher's... like, strong will, they're both traits that I really admire. Graphic designer or not.]

00:01:52.120 --> 000:02:23.120
[What is Your Favourite Hobby?] So what I was playing was called kendama. IS called kendama. It's a Japanese skill toy, traditional skill toy, with three cups, a spike, and a ball attached to a string. The ball has a hole in it too. Teaches you about balance and patience. Easy to learn, but of course, hard to master.]
