[Intro]

2
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.150
Hi, I'm Ian.

3
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.160
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

4
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.220
Motion graphics. I just love the idea of animating and bringing my designs to life. 

5
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.140
[What influences your work as a designer?]


6
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.100
the content I consume, so TV shows, movies, music for books. 

7
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.050
[What is your dream company/studio to work with?] 

8
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.220
would probably be something like WB games,

9
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.180
in a motion capacity,


10
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.140
but my dream would be to apply my designs in content I would like to consume normally.

11
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.150
[What is your favourite colour?] 

12
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.160
My favourite colour, 

13
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.000
typically I'd want to say black, most people call it a shade. 

14
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.010
So I'd have to say a nice, like dark Royal purple. 

15
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.190
[What is your favourite font? What font describes your personality?]

16
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.170
My favourite font is freight.

17
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.040
And a font that describes my personality. 

18
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.100
I want to say Wolf’s Bane it’s a decorative font so it's a little extra, it's sharp, bold kind of eccentric.

19
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.140
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]


20
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.170
I mean, as mentioned before, I like to read, watch TV, play video games, I guess, listening to music counts.

21
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.000
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

22
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.210
And my favourite Adobe application to work with is InDesign,

23
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:59.170
I like how nicely it is to work in, how everything gets packaged at the end and how it can just flow all the content.

24
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.170
It's definitely my favourite aside from AfterEffects.

25
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.180
And that's a little bit about me as a designer. 

26
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.030
Thank you for watching.

27
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.010
