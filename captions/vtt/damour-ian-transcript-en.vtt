[Intro]

2
00:00:12.11 --> 00:00:13.15
Hi, I'm Ian.

3
00:00:15.14 --> 00:00:18.16
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

4
00:00:19.05 --> 00:00:23.22
Motion graphics. I just love the idea of animating and bringing my designs to life. 

5
00:00:24.23 --> 00:00:27.14
[What influences your work as a designer?]


6
00:00:27.20 --> 00:00:33.10
the content I consume, so TV shows, movies, music for books. 

7
00:00:34.15 --> 00:00:37.05
[What is your dream company/studio to work with?] 

8
00:00:37.17 --> 00:00:40.22
would probably be something like WB games,

9
00:00:41.17 --> 00:00:42.18
in a motion capacity,


10
00:00:42.20 --> 00:00:49.14
but my dream would be to apply my designs in content I would like to consume normally.

11
00:00:51.01 --> 00:00:53.15
[What is your favourite colour?] 

12
00:00:54.06 --> 00:00:55.16
My favourite colour, 

13
00:00:56.04 --> 00:00:59.00
typically I'd want to say black, most people call it a shade. 

14
00:00:59.10 --> 00:01:04.01
So I'd have to say a nice, like dark Royal purple. 

15
00:01:04.19 --> 00:01:06.19
[What is your favourite font? What font describes your personality?]

16
00:01:09.00 --> 00:01:11.17
My favourite font is freight.

17
00:01:12.04 --> 00:01:15.04
And a font that describes my personality. 

18
00:01:16.13 --> 00:01:24.10
I want to say Wolf’s Bane it’s a decorative font so it's a little extra, it's sharp, bold kind of eccentric.

19
00:01:25.12 --> 00:01:28.14
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]


20
00:01:29.04 --> 00:01:37.17
I mean, as mentioned before, I like to read, watch TV, play video games, I guess, listening to music counts.

21
00:01:38.23 --> 00:01:42.00
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

22
00:01:42.19 --> 00:01:46.21
And my favourite Adobe application to work with is InDesign,

23
00:01:47.15 --> 00:01:59.17
I like how nicely it is to work in, how everything gets packaged at the end and how it can just flow all the content.

24
00:02:01.05 --> 00:02:04.17
It's definitely my favourite aside from AfterEffects.

25
00:02:07.11 --> 00:02:09.18
And that's a little bit about me as a designer. 

26
00:02:11.23 --> 00:02:13.03
Thank you for watching.

27
00:02:13.17 --> 00:02:18.01
