[Intro]

2
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14:010
Hi there I'm Bria. 

3
00:00:14:020 -->  00:00:20:030
I just wanted to start off by saying thank you for taking the time to watch this video.

4
00:00:20:040 --> 00:00:25:270
Obviously it would have been a lot nicer to be doing this in person, 

5
00:00:25:280 --> 00:00:32:040
but I'm just going to answer a couple of questions so you can get to know me a bit better, 

6
00:00:32:050 --> 00:00:35.130
and that way we can connect virtually.

7
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.180
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

8
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41:270
I was inspired to pursue graphic design. 

9
00:00:41:280 --> 00:00:47:260
After I explored two different career paths, the first one was interior decorating. 

10
00:00:47:270 --> 00:00:57:230
The second was, event management and. Yeah, well, ultimately drew me to graphic design was the voice that you have creatively. 

11
00:00:57:240 --> 00:01:04:150
Um, just being able to express yourself, but also solve problems in a meaningful way. 

12
00:01:04:160 --> 00:01:17.050
I think that that's a huge responsibility for graphic designers. Just contributing to better solutions for a better world. 

13
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.290
[What is your unique selling point as a designer?]

14
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:30:190
Illustration and hand lettering. Um, illustration is something that I've always loved ever since I've been a kid. 

15
00:01:30:200 --> 00:01:39:120
And I never truly believed that I could create a solid career in illustration or art. 

16
00:01:39:130 --> 00:01:47:150
So that's something that I'm very grateful to be able to apply to my career and my work life now. 

17
00:01:47:160 --> 00:01:55:280
Another unique selling point that I have would be, my love for sustainability, my passion for sustainability. 

18
00:01:55:290 --> 00:02:03:140
I really want to learn more about sustainable graphic design and sustainable package design. 

19
00:02:03:150 --> 00:02:13:020
So knowing that those are things that I want to work toward and continue my learning, I think are really good goals for myself. 

20
00:02:13:030 --> 00:02:25:140
And another unique selling point would be my like determination, I guess, to always keep expanding my personal development. 

21
00:02:25:150 --> 00:02:34.170
I'm always very interested in self-help books. Self-improvement podcasts. I'll listen to Brene Brown all day long. 

22
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.270
[Where do you see yourself in 5 years?]

23
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:47:200
In five years, I can see myself being on a path to becoming a creative director or an art director. 

24
00:02:47:210 --> 00:02:57:000
I very much gravitate to leadership roles. Um, I have strong communication skills.

25
00:02:57:010 --> 00:03:03:070
I'm determined. I'm a team player and I have good decision-making skills. 

26
00:03:03:080 --> 00:03:12.130
So, I think that having experience as a creative director would be something that I'm very interested in. 

27
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.040
Thank you again for taking the time to watch this video and I hope we can talk soon. Bye.

28
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.210
