Hi, my name is Kathleen Chamberland and I'm a third year graphic design student. Here are a few facts about me as a designer.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.250
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

4
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.130
I've always loved the thought of being a graphic designer,

5
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.040
even from a young age; you could find me playing around with Photoshop.

6
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.220
So when I graduated from high school, I thought if this is something I like to do, why not get paid for it?

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.200
And here I am, three years later!

[What is your favourite colour? Pantone or Hex?]

9
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.070
My favorite colour probably have to be Pantone Living Coral.

10
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.000
I just find that itâ€™s a nice warm shade, and it reminds me of summer.

11
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

12
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.280
My favourite Adobe app would have to be photoshop.

13
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.100
I find it's a great tool that really helps me express my creative side.
