[Intro]

2
00:00:12.04 --> 00:00:13.20
It’s nice to meet you! I’m Zach

3
00:00:14.00 --> 00:00:17.10
and welcome to my page here on this years Grad-site.

4
00:00:18.09 --> 00:00:21.00
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

5
00:00:21.12 --> 00:00:25.12
I started to design when I was just a kid learning to apply motion and design within 

6
00:00:26.01 --> 00:00:28.20
videos and for me and my friends YouTube pages,

7
00:00:28.23 --> 00:00:31.23
doing sport or playing video games.

8
00:00:32.09 --> 00:00:38.06
and 10 years later, here I am officially a designer? 

9
00:00:38.09 --> 00:00:42.17
It’s been an honour to get this far and have developed my skills this much.


10
00:00:43.20 --> 00:00:46.13
[What is your favourite colour? Pantone or hex?]

11
00:00:47.00 --> 00:00:51.21
Personally, I consider myself a fan of every colour and every design.

12
00:00:53.07 --> 00:00:58.08
I find the fun and the challenge in creating designs that 
13
00:00:58.09 --> 00:01:02.22
fit best with the client and with what needs to be done

14
00:01:03.17 --> 00:01:07.09
and I rarely stay to the same colours, styles, or fonts.

15
00:01:07.10 --> 00:01:13.15
I really focus on what's really going to be the best product out there.

16
00:01:14.12 --> 00:01:17.06
[What does graphic design mean to you?]

17
00:01:17.07 --> 00:01:26.04
I love the diversity of design and the art of communication, the art of communicating with design itself.

18
00:01:26.18 --> 00:01:32.00
I’m really excited for the future of design and what it has to hold. 

19
00:01:32.23 --> 00:01:37.03
I hope to get meet you on that path.
