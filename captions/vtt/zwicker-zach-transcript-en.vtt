[Intro]

2
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.200
It’s nice to meet you! I’m Zach

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.100
and welcome to my page here on this years Grad-site.

4
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.000
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

5
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.120
I started to design when I was just a kid learning to apply motion and design within 

6
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.200
videos and for me and my friends YouTube pages,

7
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.230
doing sport or playing video games.

8
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.060
and 10 years later, here I am officially a designer? 

9
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.170
It’s been an honour to get this far and have developed my skills this much.


10
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.130
[What is your favourite colour? Pantone or hex?]

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.210
Personally, I consider myself a fan of every colour and every design.

12
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.08
I find the fun and the challenge in creating designs that 
13
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.220
fit best with the client and with what needs to be done

14
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.090
and I rarely stay to the same colours, styles, or fonts.

15
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.150
I really focus on what's really going to be the best product out there.

16
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.060
[What does graphic design mean to you?]

17
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:26.040
I love the diversity of design and the art of communication, the art of communicating with design itself.

18
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.000
I’m really excited for the future of design and what it has to hold. 

19
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.030
I hope to get meet you on that path.
