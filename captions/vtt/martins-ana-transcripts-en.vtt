[What inspires you  as a graphic designer?]

2
00:00:16:000 --> 00:00:21:000 
As a graphic designer, I find my inspiration all around.

3
00:00:21:000 --> 00:00:26:000 
I get inspired by music, colour, nature, people.

4
00:00:26:000 --> 00:00:36:000 
I'm always on the lookout - I watch films, I observe people in the street, I think about conversations I had. 

5
00:00:36:000 --> 00:00:44:000 
I also like checking Pinterest and Behance, and seeing other people's styles with a critical eye.

6
00:00:44:000 --> 00:00:51:000 
I try to stay on top of trends and know what's going on in the industry.

7
00:00:51:000 --> 00:01:01:000 
So, I just stay aware of what I am seeing and why I'm liking it, and how it's resonating with me.

8
00:01:01:000 --> 00:01:05:000 
Then I analyze it, see if I can emulate that.

9
00:01:05:000 --> 00:01:11:000 
See if I can create a feeling similar to the one I'm liking. 

10
00:01:11:000 --> 00:01:22:000 
It's just a questioning process. So, I would say influences are just in the world we walk through and interact with.
