[Intro]

2
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.160
Hey. It’s nice to meet you.

3
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.070
My name is MacKenzie, and I’m a graphic designer interested in everything digital.

4
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.140
[What is your unique selling point as a designer?]

5
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.000
I enjoy designing for the web, I love UI/UX,

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.100
and I’ve really enjoyed the opportunities that we’ve had to learn to code, even if it’s just a little.

7
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.250
[What does graphic design mean to you?]

8
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:45.100
I really love graphic design because it’s a chance to make things that aren’t just beautiful and meaningful and useful,

9
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.050
but things that can really be enjoyed by everyone; things that are truly accessible.

10
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.220
It’s a little hard to know what to say exactly in a format like this, and I don’t want to take too much of your time,

11
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.250
so if you’re interested in seeing any of my work, there are some snapshots down below;

12
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.270
and if you’d like to get in touch with me, there’s a bunch of information over here.

13
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.180
Thank you so much for your time, and I hope to see you around.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.030
