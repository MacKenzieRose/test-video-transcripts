I was originally told to go into graphic design by my grade 11 teacher for art.

2
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.000
Instead of going into an art profession I went into Architectural Technician right out of high school

3
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.100
and that kinda taught me how to learn a few creative programs, which was nice,

4
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.100
but it also taught me how much I want to stay away from anything architecturally related, mathematical, or engineering.

5
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.100
So, that really reinforced how much I love the artistic part of it and the design aspects of it.

6
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.200
So I went straight away and enrolled in graphic design at Algonquin and I'll be graduating soon. That's pretty cool.

7
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.100
My favourite class in graphic design would have to be motion graphics.

8
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.300
Making everything move and dance on the screen, it's just super cool watching everything come to life.

9
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.100
I have a kind of feel about how the motion should be so its a little- a lot enjoyable to me.

10
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.200
To just dive right in and figure out how to animate something.

11
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:58.200
My favourite colour is RGB 0, 255, 255. CMYK 100, 0, 0, 0. Pure cyan.

12
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.100
Its a powerful colour, energetic to say the least. It also has a little sentimental value

13
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:15.100
because its the one that I always picked with my friends when we played Age of Empires. Always pick cyan, it's the best colour.

14
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.200
A hobby that I have that isn't graphic design but I guess it is tangentially related

15
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.100
is painting Warhammer models. Putting them together, painting them up, it's a nice experience.

16
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.100
I get to put them on my desk and they look really nice, umm, I'm looking at one now.

17
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.300
It's just a fun little melt the world away type of thing, you know?

18
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.100
There's that, there's 3d printing and laser etching, kinda dabble in that stuff as well. Lots of cool stuff.
