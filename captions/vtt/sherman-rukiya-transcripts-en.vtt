[What Inspired You to Pursue Graphic Design?]

3
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.260
What made me want to pursue drawing is my passion for drawing, ever since I was young I loved to draw portraits 

4
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.250
and just drawing in general, and just being creative. If I could make something at home, DIY it [Do It Yourself] 

5
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.250
instead of going out to a store and buying it, then I would.

6
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.110
In my grade 12 year of high school, I knew that I wanted to pursue something creative 

7
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.080
and when I found out graphic design was a creative field I knew that it was the path I wanted to take.

[What are some great things youâ€™ve done to adapt to the work/school from home life?]

9
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.020
How I have adapted my school work from home is by getting a bigger desk,

10
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.120
because the desk I had before was very small, could barely fit my laptop on it. 

11
00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.200
So I for sure went to IKEA and got a huge desk that could fit all my needs.

12
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:08.150
And I also got a PC. One with larger, storage more RAM just to do my heavy duty After Effects projects on.

13
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.200
And I started using Trello which is a great online service where you can organize and plan projects.

14
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.140
I have a category for things that I need to do, that I'm currently doing and I've completed. 

15
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.090
So that's been a great tool for me to use to organize all my responsibilities.
