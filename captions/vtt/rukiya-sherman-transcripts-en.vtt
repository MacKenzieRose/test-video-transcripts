[What Inspired You to Pursue Graphic Design?]
What made me want to pursue drawing is my passion for drawing, ever since I was young I loved to draw portraits and drawing in general. I've always been a creative person, if I could make something at home, DIY (Do It Yourself) instead of buying it in store then I would.

In my grade 12 year of high school, I knew I wanted to pursue something creative and when I found out graphic design was a creative field I knew that it was the path I wanted to take.

[What are some great things youâ€™ve done to adapt to the work/school from home life?]
How I have adapted my school work from home is by getting a new desk because the desk I had before was very small and barely fit my laptop on it. So I went to IKEA and got a huge desk that could fit all my needs.

I also got a PC. One with larger, storage more RAM just to do my heavy duty After Effects projects on.  And I started using Trello which is a great online service where you can organize and plan projects.

I have a category for things that I need to do, that I'm currently doing and I've completed. So that's been a great tool for me to use to organize all my responsibilities.
