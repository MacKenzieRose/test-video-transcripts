[Intro]

2
00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:15.348
[What influences your work as a designer?]

3
00:00:15.553 --> 00:00:17.517I get a lot of inspiration from traditional animation.

4
00:00:17.729 --> 00:00:20.145
I love that a lot of texture and grit into my motion pieces.

5
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.063
It just gives it that tactile feel and makes it

6
00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.566
[feel] like it was all done by hand and not generated from a computer.

7
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:28.486[What is your favourite font?]

8
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:30.495One of my current favourite fonts is New Spirit.

9
00:00:30.595 --> 00:00:32.542
It's a very round serif font that brings a lot of character

10
00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:33.499
to certain designs.

11
00:00:33.887 --> 00:00:37.268
I don't use a lot of serif fonts, I always gravitate to sans-serif ones,

12
00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:40.404
but whenever I want to switch things up, New Spirit is always my go-to.

13
00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.918[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]14
00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:46.024
Well, I've always loved drawing and creating things.

15
00:00:46.057 --> 00:00:47.786
I remember the first time I'd heard about graphic design

16
00:00:47.787 --> 00:00:49.038
was around the seventh or eighth grade.

17
00:00:49.228 --> 00:00:50.793
We had to do this project on careers,

18
00:00:50.856 --> 00:00:52.067
where we took this online quiz,

19
00:00:52.159 -> 00:00:54.997
which asked us a whole bunch of questions pertaining to various jobs.

20
00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:58.449
After the quiz was done, it generated a long list of possible jobs that

21
00:00:58.594 --> 00:01:00.876
it thought best suited our personalities.

22
00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:04.424
A graphic designer was high on my list and I've just pursued it ever since.
