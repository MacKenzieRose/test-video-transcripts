[Intro Animation]\

2\
00;00;12;15 \'97> 00;00;16;05\
Hey, I'm Ayla and I'm a graphic designer specializing in motion design. \
\
3\
00;00;16;20 \'97> 00;00;20;04\
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]\
\
4\
00;00;20;08 \'97> 00;00;22;13\
I've always been a very artsy person growing up. \
\
5\
00;00;22;19 \'97> 00;00;27;08\
I've always loved to paint and draw and tell stories through little books that I would make. \
\
6\
00;00;28;25 \'97> 00;00;40;06\
And this led me into studying fine arts at Ottawa U and that's where I discovered a time-based art class, which is essentially videography and storytelling, which I absolutely fell in love with. \
\
7\
00;00;41;10 \'97> 00;00;47;12\
And then after a year or so, I decided that that program wasn't for me anymore, and that's when I discovered graphic design! \
\
8\
00;00;48;16 \'97> 00;00;57;16\
I applied on a bit of a whim and managed to get in, and then after a year or so of being in the program that's when I discovered my true love, motion design. \
\
9\
00;00;58;02 \'97> 00;00;59;03\
And here I am!\
\
10\
00;00;59;04 \'97> 00;01;02;16\
[What is your dream company/studio to work with?]\
\
11\
00;01;02;22 \'97> 00;01;06;22\
My dream studio to work for would be Gimmick Studio in Montreal. \
\
12\
00;01;06;28 \'97> 00;01;09;09\
They are a motion design specific studio. \
\
12\
00;01;10;00 \'97> 00;01;18;06\
I really admire all of their work, I love how they combine graphic design and put it into motion, which is exactly what I love to do. \
\
13\
00;01;18;15 \'97> 00;01;21;24\
So I would love the opportunity to work for them and learn from them.\
\
14\
00;01;22;14 \'97> 00;01;26;09\
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]\
\
15\
00;01;26;25 \'97> 00;01;29;13\
My favorite class in the graphic design program is obviously motion. \
\
16\
00;01;29;21 \'97> 00;01;32;23\
That's where I really fell in love and found my passion for motion design. \
\
17\
00;01;33;13 \'97> 00;01;37;21\
And I feel like that's the class that I was able to grow and further my skills the most in. \
\
18\
00;01;38;01 \'97> 00;01;43;23\
I'm very grateful that I was able to learn from such great motion designers, and I'm excited to pursue my career in motion design!\
\
19\
00;01;44;00 \'97> 00;01;47;08\
[What designers, brands or websites do you admire?]\
\
20\
00;01;47;18 \'97> 00;01;53;13\
Some 2D motion designers that I'm very inspired by are Ben Marriott on YouTube and Jasmine Katz, who's actually local here. \
\
21\
00;01;54;00 \'97> 00;01;59;29\
And some 3D motion artists that I also love are Joe Ryba and Made by Studio JQ, both on Instagram. \
\
22\
00;02;00;15 \'97> 00;02;06;12\
They've actually inspired me a lot to pursue 3D motion design and to take a deep dive into Cinema 4D.\
\
23\
00;02;06;26 \'97> 00;02;10;22\
[What is your favourite font?]\
\
24\
00;02;11;04 \'97> 00;02;15;01\
My favorite font has to be Termina, I use it a lot in my own personal branding. \
\
25\
00;02;15;08 \'97> 00;02;20;22\
It's a pretty simple sans-serif, but it has a lot of really cool, unique shapes, which I absolutely love. \
\
26\
00;02;21;09 \'97> 00;02;22;14\
Thanks for getting to know me!\
