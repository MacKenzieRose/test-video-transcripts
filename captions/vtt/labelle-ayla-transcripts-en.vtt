Hey, I'm Ayla and I'm a graphic designer specializing in motion design. \
\
3\
00:00:16.020 \'97> 00:00:20.004\
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]\
\
4\
00:00:20.008 \'97> 00:00:22.013\
I've always been a very artsy person growing up. \
\
5\
00:00:22.019 \'97> 00:00:27.008\
I've always loved to paint and draw and tell stories through little books that I would make. \
\
6\
00:00:28.025 \'97> 00:00:40.006\
And this led me into studying fine arts at Ottawa U and that's where I discovered a time-based art class, which is essentially videography and storytelling, which I absolutely fell in love with. \
\
7\
00:00:41.010 \'97> 00:00:47.012\
And then after a year or so, I decided that that program wasn't for me anymore, and that's when I discovered graphic design! \
\
8\
00:00:48.016 \'97> 00:00:57.016\
I applied on a bit of a whim and managed to get in, and then after a year or so of being in the program that's when I discovered my true love, motion design. \
\
9\
00:00:58.002 \'97> 00:00:59.003\
And here I am!\
\
10\
00:00:59.004 \'97> 00:01:02.016\
[What is your dream company/studio to work with?]\
\
11\
00:01:02.022 \'97> 00:01:06.022\
My dream studio to work for would be Gimmick Studio in Montreal. \
\
12\
00:01:06.028 \'97> 00:01:09.009\
They are a motion design specific studio. \
\
12\
00:01:10.000 \'97> 00:01:18.006\
I really admire all of their work, I love how they combine graphic design and put it into motion, which is exactly what I love to do. \
\
13\
00:01:18.015 \'97> 00:01:21.024\
So I would love the opportunity to work for them and learn from them.\
\
14\
00:01:22.014 \'97> 00:01:26.009\
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]\
\
15\
00:01:26.025 \'97> 00:01:29.013\
My favorite class in the graphic design program is obviously motion. \
\
16\
00:01:29.021 \'97> 00:01:32.023\
That's where I really fell in love and found my passion for motion design. \
\
17\
00:01:33.013 \'97> 00:01:37.021\
And I feel like that's the class that I was able to grow and further my skills the most in. \
\
18\
00:01:38.001 \'97> 00:01:43.023\
I'm very grateful that I was able to learn from such great motion designers, and I'm excited to pursue my career in motion design!\
\
19\
00:01:44.000 \'97> 00:01:47.008\
[What designers, brands or websites do you admire?]\
\
20\
00:01:47.018 \'97> 00:01:53.013\
Some 2D motion designers that I'm very inspired by are Ben Marriott on YouTube and Jasmine Katz, who's actually local here. \
\
21\
00:01:54.000 \'97> 00:01:59.029\
And some 3D motion artists that I also love are Joe Ryba and Made by Studio JQ, both on Instagram. \
\
22\
00:02:00.015 \'97> 00:02:06.012\
They've actually inspired me a lot to pursue 3D motion design and to take a deep dive into Cinema 4D.\
\
23\
00:02:06.026 \'97> 00:02:10.022\
[What is your favourite font?]\
\
24\
00:02:11.004 \'97> 00:02:15.001\
My favorite font has to be Termina, I use it a lot in my own personal branding. \
\
25\
00:02:15.008 \'97> 00:02:20.022\
It's a pretty simple sans-serif, but it has a lot of really cool, unique shapes, which I absolutely love. \
\
26\
00:02:21.009 \'97> 00:02:22.014\
Thanks for getting to know me!\
\
27\
