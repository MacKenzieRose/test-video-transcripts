Hey, I'm Ayla and I'm a graphic designer specializing in motion design. 

3
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.004
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

4
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:22.013
I've always been a very artsy person growing up. 

5
00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.008
I've always loved to paint and draw and tell stories through little books that I would make. 

6
00:00:28.025 --> 00:00:40.006
And this led me into studying fine arts at Ottawa U and that's where I discovered a time-based art class, which is essentially videography and storytelling, which I absolutely fell in love with. 

7
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.012
And then after a year or so, I decided that that program wasn't for me anymore, and that's when I discovered graphic design! 

8
00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:57.016
I applied on a bit of a whim and managed to get in, and then after a year or so of being in the program that's when I discovered my true love, motion design. 

9
00:00:58.002 --> 00:00:59.003
And here I am!

10
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.016
[What is your dream company/studio to work with?]

11
00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:06.022
My dream studio to work for would be Gimmick Studio in Montreal. 

12
00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:09.009
They are a motion design specific studio. 

12
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.006
I really admire all of their work, I love how they combine graphic design and put it into motion, which is exactly what I love to do. 

13
00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:21.024
So I would love the opportunity to work for them and learn from them.

14
00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:26.009
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

15
00:01:26.025 --> 00:01:29.013
My favorite class in the graphic design program is obviously motion. 

16
00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:32.023
That's where I really fell in love and found my passion for motion design. 

17
00:01:33.013 --> 00:01:37.021
And I feel like that's the class that I was able to grow and further my skills the most in. 

18
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:43.023
I'm very grateful that I was able to learn from such great motion designers, and I'm excited to pursue my career in motion design!

19
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.008
[What designers, brands or websites do you admire?]

20
00:01:47.018 --> 00:01:53.013
Some 2D motion designers that I'm very inspired by are Ben Marriott on YouTube and Jasmine Katz, who's actually local here. 

21
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.029
And some 3D motion artists that I also love are Joe Ryba and Made by Studio JQ, both on Instagram. 

22
00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:06.012
They've actually inspired me a lot to pursue 3D motion design and to take a deep dive into Cinema 4D.

23
00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:10.022
[What is your favourite font?]

24
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:15.001
My favorite font has to be Termina, I use it a lot in my own personal branding. 

25
00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:20.022
It's a pretty simple sans-serif, but it has a lot of really cool, unique shapes, which I absolutely love. 

26
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.014
Thanks for getting to know me!
