00:00:12:00 --> 00:00:18:03
As funny as I would find it to just start this by belting out what my favorite color is, I guess I should give some preface.

00:00:18:03 --> 00:00:21:17
Hey, I'm Cole Allen and here are somethings to get to know me a bit more.

[Favorite Color]

5
00:00:26:06 --> 00:00:30:22
My favorite color is black, I know its a shade, its still my favorite color.

6
00:00:30:22 --> 00:00:35:15
Specifically it's Onyx Black, Hex #353839.

7
00:00:35:15 --> 00:00:43:16
I like black overall though because of the weight it carries and the inverse pop it has compared to a bright color while achieving a similar effect.

[Favorite Adobe Suite Tool]

9
00:00:49:00 --> 00:00:51:21
Personally it's a toss up between Photoshop and After Effects.

10
00:00:51:21 --> 00:00:58:07
Photoshop because of the sheer power and I've always been interested in the manipulation of assets and using them to create your own pieces.

11
00:00:58:07 --> 00:01:04:21
After Effects is because of the ability to see the pieces I create move and having the ability to tune them to how I see fit.

[Dream Studio to Work With]

12
00:01:09:07 --> 00:01:13:05
The studio I'm most interested in working with is Papercrowns.

13
00:01:13:05 --> 00:01:19:03
They are a creative & marketing industry located in NewYork with a good amount of their projects relating to eSports.

14
00:01:19:03 --> 00:01:26:09
Asides from my personal interests, I'm always impressed by the quality of work they produce, whether its for an organization, streamer, or eSports event.

15
00:01:26:09 --> 00:01:28:23
The type of work I want to create.

[Where do I see Myself in 5 Years]

17
00:01:33:11 --> 00:01:39:18
In 5 years I would like to be working in a design studio that is involved in creating eSports related content.

18
00:01:39:18 --> 00:01:44:12
I think it would be the best way of integrating my passion for games into my design.

19
00:01:44:12 --> 00:01:49:03
Thanks for taking the time to watch my little interview clip.

20
00:01:49:03 --> 00:01:51:06
I hope to hear something from you guys soon
