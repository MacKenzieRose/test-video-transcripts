As funny as I would find it to just start this by belting out what my favorite color is, I guess I should give some preface.

[Favorite Color]

5
0:00:26:06 - 0:00:30:22
My favorite color is black, I know its a shade, its still my favorite color.

6
0:00:30:22 - 0:00:35:15
Specifically it's Onyx Black, Hex #353839.

7
0:00:35:15 - 0:00:43:16
I like black overall though because of the weight it carries and the inverse pop it has compared to a bright color while achieving a similar effect.

[Favorite Adobe Suite Tool]

Personally it's a toss up between Photoshop and After Effects.

10
0:00:51:21 - 0:00:58:07
Photoshop because of the sheer power and I've always been interested in the manipulation of assets and using them to create your own pieces.

11
0:00:58:07 - 0:01:04:21
After Effects is because of the ability to see the pieces I create move and having the ability to tune them to how I see fit.

[Dream Studio to Work With]

12
0:01:09:07 - 0:01:13:05
The studio I'm most interested in working with is Papercrowns.

13
0:01:13:05 - 0:01:19:03
They are a creative & marketing industry located in NewYork with a good amount of their projects relating to eSports.

14
0:01:19:03 - 0:01:26:09
Asides from my personal interests, I'm always impressed by the quality of work they produce, whether its for an organization, streamer, or eSports event.

15
0:01:26:09 - 0:01:28:23
The type of work I want to create.

[Where do I see Myself in 5 Years]

17
0:01:33:11 - 0:01:39:18
In 5 years I would like to be working in a design studio that is involved in creating eSports related content.

18
0:01:39:18 - 0:01:44:12
I think it would be the best way of integrating my passion for games into my design.
