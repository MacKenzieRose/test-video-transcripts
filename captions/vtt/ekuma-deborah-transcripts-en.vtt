The graphic design program was a learning experience for me.

[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

5 
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.270
What inspired me to pursue a career in graphic design is my interest in art.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:43.050
As an artist, I'm always looking for ways to show art or a different medium to show art. So I decided to look into the graphic design program.

[What influences your work as a designer?]

12
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.040
I say what influences me the most is creativity.

13
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:25.090
Creativity makes me look at things or think about a problem from a whole different point of view

14
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:34.140
and makes me see, try to see how I can solve a problem, you know, from a from a different point of view.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.180
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

Apart from being a graphic designer, I am also a painter. I would say I am an abstract and expressive painter.
