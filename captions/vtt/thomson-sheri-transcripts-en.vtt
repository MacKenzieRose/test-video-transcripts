00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.500
What inspired me to pursue graphic design would be my love for collaborative art.

2
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.500
I've worked with various artists before in the past, as well as taught art history to children within the community.

3
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.500
I wanted to do something practical with that passion and build off the creativity to establish a career.

4
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.150
My unique selling point would be my age as a mature graphic designer.

5
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:51.200
I can bring lived experience to the table as well as my background in marketing, which allows me to approach projects from a different angle. 

6
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:03.000
In five years, I can see myself working in a creative agency, leading a team of people and sharing our voices.

7
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.100
I'd be the liaison between stakeholders and the company nurturing these relationships.

8
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.250
Um, and also having a diploma in marketing and advertising communications management. Well, just overall,

9
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.200
will give me all the tools that I need to land a role in graphic design as well as project management. 

10
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.100
Adapting to remote learning and working from home has been very challenging.

11
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.100
Especially because I'm not the only one working from home. I have my children here as well,

12
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.200
and, uh, I've really had to take the time to pause and live in the moment,

13
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.300
make sure that I get outside practice self-care and spend time with my family 

14
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.100
Graphic design to me means, addressing tasks collaboratively with clients

15
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.000
and finding a solution that visually communicates the message being spoken.

16
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.000
It means looking for creative solutions that are appealing to the target audience.
