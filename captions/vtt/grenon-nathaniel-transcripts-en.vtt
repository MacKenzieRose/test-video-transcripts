[Intro]

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.260
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

3
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.110
Back in High-School I was given a chance to create a t-shirt design for a volley-ball tournament we where hosting, 

4
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.290
and since then I decided I wanted to become a graphic designer.

5
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.130
[What influences your work as a designer?]

6
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:36.200
I think other designers influenced my work. I tend to look on social media and Reddit and stuff and find really cool work,

7
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.140
and I think it drives me to become better.

8
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.280
[What is your dream studio/company to work with?]

9
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.290
I don't really have a dream company slash studio. It'd be cool to work for a team franchise or something like that,

10
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.290
like a sports franchise. Other than that, I'd be happy to work for any company or studio.

11
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.130
[What is your unique selling point as a designer?]

12
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.110
My unique selling point would be that I learn skills really quickly. 

13
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.240
I pride myself in being able to learn a lot of different things for different programs and being good at it.

14
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.230
[What was your favourite class?]

15
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:26.050
My favourite class would have to be computer graphics. It's what I like doing the most and what I'm best at, and I thought it was really fun.

16
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.040
[Favourite font? What font describes your personality?]

17
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:39.100
My favourite font would be "Roboto". It's what I've been using the most lately. I find it matches my personality and my brand a lot.

18
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.020 
And I've noticed that it works well with a lot of different brands.

19
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.160
[Where do you see yourself in 5 years?]

20
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:54.400
In five years. I don't really see, I don't know. I don't see myself that far ahead and I just see myself being,

21
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.270 
I guess, a successful graphic designer doing well in my field.

22
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.260
[What other passion and hobbies do you have?]

23
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.140
Are there passion and hobbies. I'd say I love playing hockey. Uh, I love fishing even though I don't go all that often.

24
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.100
And of course, I'd have to say video games.

25
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.090
[What are some great things you've done to adapt to the work/school away from home life?]

26
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:28.140
Some of the great things I've adapted from, I guess, would just be being independent. Um, I've learned how to cook since I've left home.

27
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:38.090 
Other than that, nothing has really changed for me. COVID, hasn't really made that huge of a dent in my lifestyle. So yeah.

28
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.230
[What does graphic design mean to you?]

29
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:52.020
I think graphic design to me means being able to share a message with your audience, with your creativity.

30
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.010
[What is your favourite adobe application to work with?]

31
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:07.190
And my favourite application would have to be, originally, I think I'd say Photoshop, but now I think I'd say after effects,

32
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.190
just because it's something new to me and I really love what I'm learning on it.

33
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.150
