[Intro]

2
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.000
Hi! Thanks for checking out my page. Let's get to know me a little better.

3
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.250
What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

4
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.240
So, I started at uOttawa studying communications. 

5
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.280
I did a lot of research, I wrote a lot of papers, learned a lot. 

6
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.020
But I realized that, after I graduated, 

7
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.030
none of the jobs really got me excited to go to work. 

8
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.040
So, I figured why not? 

9
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.100
I like art. 

10
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.260
And if it worked out, perfect! 

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.050
And if it didn't, I'd just keep truckin' on. 

12
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.080
And I'm here so I guess it worked out.

13
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.250
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

14
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.210
I have a bit of an opposing view on the best class. 

15
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.190
I personally really liked web dev. 

16
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.000
Which was a shocker to me because I'd never done coding before I got into the program, 

17
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.000
so I didn't know what I was getting into. 

18
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.210
But, I quickly realized that this makes sense in my head. 

19
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.260
It's kind of like a puzzle that you have to figure out where the pieces go, and I liked it.

20
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.140
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.160
Aside from graphic design, and I guess similar to graphic design, 

22
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.070
most of my hobbies are art related. Shocker. 

23
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.120
I've been sewing and knitting since I was about 10, 

24
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.200
and I grew up doing crafts with my grandma so 

25
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.140
I love crafts like cross-stitching and embroidering cards, and things like that. 

26
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.000
SO, pretty much anything craft related that I can make is kind of my schtick. 

27
00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.240
