Hi I’m Niall Boyd, I’m a Graphic Designer specialising in Branding, Motion Graphics and Stylized Illustrations.

3
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.190
Here are a bunch of questions about me as a Designer.

4
00:00:24.000  --> 00:00:30.140
[What Inspired You to Pursue Graphic Design]
I’ve always been interested in art, as a kid, such as drawing or telling stories.

5
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.020
But it was only in high school when I was unsure what I wanted to do.

6
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:45.190
My Mum introduced to me a SHSM which is a Specialised Highschool Major at Merivale High School where I got to learn Graphic Design, Photography and Animation.

7
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.020
I was close to the program coordinator and he inspired me to pursue Graphic Design.

8
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.200
[What influences your work as a designer?]
Music inspires my work.

9
00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:03.220
I also like to research and understand new design trends and also previous design movements.

10
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.130
I often go back to the Bauhaus as a source of inspiration because a lot of their work is still strong to this day.

11
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:20.050
[What designers, brands or websites do you admire?]
I am inspired by designers such as Aaron Draplin, Jessica Hische, Michael Beirut, and many other designers past and the present.

12
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:31.000
I find that each of them have their various different personalities and styles with their designs but they all communicate using Graphic Design.

13
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:43.130
[What is your unique selling point as a designer?]
I feel my unique selling point as a designer is my knowledge and interest into other  previous design movements, arts and styles to incorporate into my work.

14
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.020
[What is your favourite colour? Pantone or hex?]
I feel my hex code is #46122c which is a burgundy type colour.

15
00:01:51.020 --> 00:02:00.090
The burgundy type was  present throughout my youth as well in Harry Potter such as in Gryffindor’s coat of arms.

16
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.220
It's also in my branding as well as on my site.

17
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.160
[What is your favourite font? What font describes your personality?]
Filson Pro best describes my personality.

18
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:18.210
It’s a font that appears at first glance all professional but until you see R, T and K it shows its playful side.

19
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.100
[What does graphic design mean to you?]
I believe that Graphic Design has the potential to inform and educate.

20
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:31.110
It drives me because Graphic Design can use visual communication to reach audiences that have been ignored.

21
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.230
I find if you design simple it can be more effective.
