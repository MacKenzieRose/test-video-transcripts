[Intro]

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.300
Hi, I'm Chris.

3
00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:17.041
[What inspired you to purse graphic design?]

4
00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.999
I didn't know what I wanted to do as a career until

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.166
I was 26 years old.

6
00:00:22.187 --> 00:00:27.500
I felt unfulfilled and generally unhappy for a long time,

7
00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:29.958
working construction and other jobs.

8
00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:35.750
It was when I moved to Ottawa, and I met my cousins wife

9
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:39.505
who had taken this program just a year or two prior.

10
00:00:41.413 --> 00:00:46.791
Just through talking to her and she giving me all the details of the program

11
00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:48.541
and what you do as a graphic designer

12
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.416
I just felt this fire inside of me spark up.

13
00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:57.191
It's been burning ever since

14
00:00:57.482 --> 00:01:01.556
and I really feel like it's what I'm supposed to do,

15
00:01:01.557 --> 00:01:02.559
It's what I want to do.

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.416
[What influences your work as a designer?]

17
00:01:06.714 --> 00:01:09.166
I try to find inspiration in everything around me,

18
00:01:09.947 --> 00:01:16.416
all the time. So definitely my environment, trying new things,

17
00:01:17.157 --> 00:01:21.587
talking to new people, conversations with my classmates, other designers

18
00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:26.599
There's probably a huge list of things that affect me subconsciously.

19
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.708
[What is your unique selling point as a designer?]

20
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.000
Personally, I think my compassion, my empathy, my honesty

21
00:01:37.123 --> 00:01:40.500
and my openness are what make me unique.

22
00:01:42.022 --> 00:01:44.791
I really care about my work and my clients,

23
00:01:45.013 --> 00:01:47.664
And just everyone's happiness

24
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.456
a lot.

25
00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958
[What is your favourite class in the program?]

26
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:56.297
I really enjoyed Motion and Typography the most.

27
00:01:56.572 --> 00:01:59.983
Making things come to life with animation is super cool,

28
00:02:00.258 --> 00:02:04.299
and working with type, I think, one of my strongest skill sets.

29
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:08.541
[What is your favourite font? What font describes your personality?]

30
00:02:08.713 --> 00:02:11.639
Well, I don't have a favourite font, I don't think,

31
00:02:11.736 --> 00:02:14.080
but I definitely have a few go-to's.

32
00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:18.348
Sofia, Freight, Kepler,

33
00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:22.390
there's a few others but those are pretty solid.

34
00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:25.656
As for a font that describes my personality?

35
00:02:26.027 --> 00:02:28.792
Um... maybe Whomp.

36
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.607
I dunno. I like the name, it's kind of funky.

37
00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.272
Yeah, Whomp.

38
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:38.333
[What does graphic design mean to you?]

39
00:02:38.335 --> 00:02:43.208
It's solving a problem, communicating a message, helping someone,

40
00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:46.865
enhancing some aspect of this life through

41
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.333
the appropriate avenues, while having fun.

42
00:02:51:17 --> 00:02:55.874
There is definitely a lot of research and ideation that goes into great design,

43
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:56.780
I think.

44
00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:01.041-->
