Hi, I'm Chris.

3
00:00:13:16 —> 00:00:17:01
[What inspired you to purse graphic design?]

4
00:00:17:02 —> 00:00:20:00
I didn't know what I wanted to do as a career until

5
00:00:20:01 —> 00:00:22:04
I was 26 years old.

6
00:00:22:05 —> 00:00:27:12
I felt unfulfilled and generally unhappy for a long time,

7
00:00:27:13 —> 00:00:29:23
working construction and other jobs.

8
00:00:31:16 —> 00:00:35:18
It was when I moved to Ottawa, and I met my cousins wife

9
00:00:35:19 —> 00:00:39:14
who had taken this program just a year or two prior.

10
00:00:41:09 —> 00:00:46:19
Just through talking to her and she giving me all the details of the program

11
00:00:46:20 —> 00:00:48:13
and what you do as a graphic designer

12
00:00:49:11 —> 00:00:53:06
I just felt this fire inside of me spark up.

13
00:00:55:11 —> 00:00:56:18
It's been burning ever since

14
00:00:56:19 —> 00:01:01:14
and I really feel like it's what I'm supposed to do,

15
00:01:01:15 —> 00:01:02:11
It's what I want to do.

16
00:01:03:01 —> 00:01:06:10
[What influences your work as a designer?]

17
00:01:06:11 —> 00:01:09:04
I try to find inspiration in everything around me,

18
00:01:09:05 —> 00:01:16:10
all the time. So definitely my environment, trying new things,

17
00:01:17:03 —> 00:01:21:18
talking to new people, conversations with my classmates, other designers

18
00:01:21:19 —> 00:01:26:14
There's probably a huge list of things that affect me subconsciously.

19
00:01:27:07 —> 00:01:30:17
[What is your unique selling point as a designer?]

20
00:01:30:18 —> 00:01:30:23
Personally, I think my compassion, my empathy, my honesty

21
00:01:31:00 —> 00:01:40:12
and my openness are what make me unique.

22
00:01:42:02 —> v00:01:44:19
I really care about my work and my clients,

23
00:01:44:20 —> 00:01:47:22
And just everyone's happiness

24
00:01:47:23 —> 00:01:48:00
a lot.

25
00:01:49:00 —> 00:01:52:23
[What is your favourite class in the program?]

26
00:01:53:00 —> 00:01:56:08
I really enjoyed Motion and Typography the most.

27
00:01:56:09 —> 00:01:59:22
Making things come to life with animation is super cool,

28
00:01:59:23 —> 00:02:04:07
and working with type, I think, one of my strongest skill sets.

29
00:02:04:16 —> 00:02:08:13
[What is your favourite font? What font describes your personality?]

30
00:02:08:14 —> 00:02:11:17
Well, I don't have a favourite font, I don't think,

31
00:02:11:18 —> 00:02:14:02
but I definitely have a few go-to's.

32
00:02:14:03 —> 00:02:18:05
Sofia, Freight, Kepler,

33
00:02:18:06 —> 00:02:22:10
there's a few others but those are pretty solid.

34
00:02:22:23 —> 00:02:25:16
As for a font that describes my personality?

35
00:02:25:17 —> 00:02:28:22
Um... maybe Whomp.

36
00:02:29:17 —> 00:02:32:17
I dunno. I like the name, it's kind of funky.

37
00:02:33:07 —> 00:02:34:19
Yeah, Whomp.

38
00:02:34:20 —> 00:02:38:08
[What does graphic design mean to you?]

39
00:02:38:09 —> 00:02:42:23
It's solving a problem, communicating a message, helping someone,

40
00:02:43:00 —> 00:02:46:20
enhancing some aspect of this life through

41
00:02:46:21 —> 00:02:51:06
the appropriate avenues, while having fun.

42
00:02:51:17 —> 00:02:56:03
There is definitely a lot of research and ideation that goes into great design,

43
00:02:56:04 —> 00:02:57:05
I think.
