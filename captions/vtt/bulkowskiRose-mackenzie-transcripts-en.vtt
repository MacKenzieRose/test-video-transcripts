[Intro]

0;00;12;190 --> 0;00;15;160
Hey. It’s nice to meet you.

3
0;00;15;160 --> 0;00;20;070
My name is MacKenzie, and I’m a graphic designer interested in everything digital. 

4
0;00;20;280 --> 0;00;23;140
[What is your unique selling point as a designer?]

5
0;00;24;030 --> 0;00;28;000
I enjoy designing for the web, I love UI/UX, 

6
0;00;28;000 --> 0;00;32;100
and I’ve really enjoyed the opportunities that we’ve had to learn to code, even if it’s just a little.  

7
0;00;33;100 --> 0;00;35;250
[What does graphic design mean to you?]

8
0;00;36;140 --> 0;00;45;100
I really love graphic design because it’s a chance to make things that aren’t just beautiful and meaningful and useful, 

9
0;00;45;100 --> 0;00;51;050
but things that can really be enjoyed by everyone; things that are truly accessible. 

10
0;00;52;050 --> 0;00;59;220
It’s a little hard to know what to say exactly in a format like this, and I don’t want to take too much of your time, 

11
0;00;59;220 --> 0;01;03;250
so if you’re interested in seeing any of my work, there are some snapshots down below; 

12
0;01;03;250 --> 0;01;07;270
and if you’d like to get in touch with me, there’s a bunch of information over here. 

13
0;01;07;270 --> 0;01;11;180
Thank you so much for your time, and I hope to see you around.
