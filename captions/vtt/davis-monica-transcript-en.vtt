00:00:13.21 --> 00:00:21.14
Hi my name is Monica Davis and I am UX/UI Designer who's just graduated from the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College.  

3
00:00:22.23 --> 00:00:25.13
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

4
00:00:26.00 --> 00:00:33.23
What inspired me to pursue graphic design was after getting my diploma in photography I decided I wanted to further my education

5
00:00:34.00 --> 00:00:45.11
and specifically I want to learn a lot more about the different softwares that Adobe offered and I felt that graphic design really fit the needs that I was looking for.


6
00:00:46.12 --> 00:00:45.18
[What does graphic Design mean to you?]

7
00:00:50.02 --> 00:00:59.08
Graphic design to me really means being handed a problem and finding a creative and fun solution that works for everyone involved.

8
00:01:00.12 --> 00:01:03.18
[What was your favourite class?]

9
00:01:03.20 --> 00:01:12.20
Throughout my three years Algonquin, I'd  have to say my favourite class in the beginning it was probably typography,


10
00:01:12.23 --> 00:01:19.01
I really enjoyed that class but as the years progressed I really found myself gravitating towards you UX/UI design

11
00:01:19.07 --> 00:01:25.22
and thats specifically why I ended up pursuing that field in the end. 

12
00:01:27.02 --> 00:01:30.03
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?] 

13
00:01:30.18 --> 00:01:41.02
If I had to pick a favourite adobe program it would probably be photoshop, first, and second I really enjoy using XD.

14
00:01:41.20 --> 00:01:47.23
I find it incredibly easy to use and since I use it a lot I've grown pretty fond of it.

15
00:01:49.02 --> 00:01:51.16
[Where do you see yourself in 5 years?]

16
00:01:52.19 --> 00:02:01.13
And in 5 years I hope to see myself working with an amazing team and just creating and having a lot of fun everyday

17
00:02:02.22 --> 00:02:07.00
and just really enjoying what I do in my life and in my work.

18
00:02:07.07 --> 00:02:09.05
Anyway, Thanks!
