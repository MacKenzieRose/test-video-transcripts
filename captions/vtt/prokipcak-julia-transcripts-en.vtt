[Intro]

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.240
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.080
Well I've always really liked to create things and I loved creating with a purpose.

4
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:27.010
I have been doing art since I was a very young child. In high school I took integrated arts,

5
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.120
I was at Merivale High School with Irving Osterer and it really drove me in the direction of graphic design,

6
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.020
and I continued taking his courses throughout high school until I graduated and decided to go into graphic design.

7
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.160
[What is your unique selling point as a designer?]

8
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.020
My unique selling point as a designer would be that I'm always adapting and designing to create business solutions and solve problems.

9
00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.210
I also really like to do work with sustainability in mind, so thats another big part of what I do.

10
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.050
[What is your favourite colour? Pantone or hex?]

11
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:22.120
My Favourite colour  would either be yellow, something like an RGB 252, 207, 67 or a sage green like 168, 176, 115 I think.

12
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.100
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

13
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:35.280
Other than graphic design I am passionate about hockey I really like playing that, I've been playing since I was 4, I think.

14
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:46.240
I like casual video games, not really first person shooter or but you know like sandbox style games and just games with one goal.

15
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:56.180
And I also like baking and cake decorating um, part time while I'm doing school I'm baking and decorating at a grocery store,

16
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.160
so I'm up early in the mornings often.

17
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.140
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

18
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.040
My favourite Adobe application has got to be illustrator
  
19
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.250 
just because I'm the most familiar with it and thats what I was using way before I started college.

20
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:22.130 
I also just really like the way all the tools work and I'm really familiar with the workspace and I find that its my most efficient way to work.

21
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.090
