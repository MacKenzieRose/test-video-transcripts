[Intro]

2
00:00:12.00 --> 00:00:15.24
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

3
00:00:15.24 --> 00:00:20.08
Well I've always really liked to create things and I loved creating with a purpose.

4
00:00:20.08 --> 00:00:27.01
I have been doing art since I was a very young child. In high school I took integrated arts,

5
00:00:27.01 --> 00:00:33.12
I was at Merivale High School with Irving Osterer and it really drove me in the direction of graphic design,

6
00:00:33.12 --> 00:00:40.02
and I continued taking his courses throughout high school until I graduated and decided to go into graphic design.

7
00:00:40.02 --> 00:00:44.16
[What is your unique selling point as a designer?]

8
00:00:44.16 --> 00:00:53.02
My unique selling point as a designer would be that I'm always adapting and designing to create business solutions and solve problems.

9
00:00:53.02 --> 00:01:00.21
I also really like to do work with sustainability in mind, so thats another big part of what I do.

10
00:01:00.21 --> 00:01:05.05
[What is your favourite colour? Pantone or hex?]

11
00:01:05.05 --> 00:01:22.12
My Favourite colour  would either be yellow, something like an RGB 252, 207, 67 or a sage green like 168, 176, 115 I think.

12
00:01:22.12 --> 00:01:27.10
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

13
00:01:27.10 --> 00:01:35.28
Other than graphic design I am passionate about hockey I really like playing that, I've been playing since I was 4, I think.

14
00:01:35.28 --> 00:01:46.24
I like casual video games, not really first person shooter or but you know like sandbox style games and just games with one goal.

15
00:01:46.24 --> 00:01:56.18
And I also like baking and cake decorating um, part time while I'm doing school I'm baking and decorating at a grocery store,

16
00:01:56.18 --> 00:01:59.16
so I'm up early in the mornings often.

17
00:01:59.16 --> 00:02:04.14
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

18
00:02:04.14 --> 00:02:08.04
My favourite Adobe application has got to be illustrator
  
19
00:02:08.04 --> 00:02:13.25 
just because I'm the most familiar with it and thats what I was using way before I started college.

20
00:02:13.25 --> 00:02:22.13 
I also just really like the way all the tools work and I'm really familiar with the workspace and I find that its my most efficient way to work.

21
00:02:22.13 --> 00:02:27.09
