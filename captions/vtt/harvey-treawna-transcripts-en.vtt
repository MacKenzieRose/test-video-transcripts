00:00:11:30 —> 00:00:14:13
Hi and thank you for joining me.

3
00:00:14:15 —> 00:00:17:18
I'm Treawna and I washed my hair today

4
00:00:17:25 —> 00:00:21:22
just as a small courtesy and an example

5
00:00:21:23—> 00:00:24:16
of how I like to go that extra mile.

6
00:00:24:17 —> 00:00:26:22
Ok, well what have you done today?

7
00:00:27:06 —> 00:00:30:07
No, no, it's been a rough year, so I do

8
00:00:30:08 —> 00:00:32:29
like to celebrate even the small accomplishments.

9
00:00:33:00 —> 00:00:35:14
I hope that wherever and whenever you're tuning

10
00:00:35:15 —> 00:00:37:13
in from that you're doing ok.

11
00:00:37:14 —> 00:00:40:22
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

12
00:00:40:23 —> 00:00:44:06
Today I'm here to celebrate a marginally larger accomplishment

13
00:00:44:07 —> 00:00:48:21
of wrapping up my third year of Algonquin's Graphic Design Program.

14
00:00:48:22 —> 00:00:54:06
100% of which was done from the comfort of my bed—office. My office.

15
00:00:54:07 —> 00:01:01:01
Speaking of threes, I believe this is my third adventure in post-secondary education.

16
00:01:01:02 —> 00:01:05:10
I attended the School of the Photographic Arts: Ottawa, which really helped

17
00:01:05:11 —> 00:01:08:25
open up the ability to express myself visually.

18
00:01:08:26 —> 00:01:13:07
Then after that, I studied nutrition, which taught me to properly

19
00:01:13:08 —> 00:01:16:23
fuel and focus this restless mind! I think what tipped me off that

20
00:01:16:29 —> 00:01:23:03
graphic design might be next was the 8 hours I once spent making a

21
00:01:23:04 —> 00:01:26:19
pamphlet/infographic about the ketogenic diet

22
00:01:26:28 —> 00:01:28:07
in nutrition school.

23
00:01:28:10 —> 00:01:32:19
And no, there weren't any marks allocated for the visuals.

24
00:01:33:05 —> 00:01:36:16
[What is your unique selling point as a designer?]

25
00:01:36:17 —> 00:01:38:23
I do love to learn and create so,

26
00:01:38:24 —> 00:01:43:07
what I appreciate most about design is the infinite ability to do both.

27
00:01:43:15 —> 00:01:48:10
As a designer, my focus is research, empathy and translation.

28
00:01:48:16 —> 00:01:52:00
I like to be highly detail oriented in each of these stages

29
00:01:52:05 —> 00:01:56:04
so we can produce meaningful work that speaks to the intended message.

30
00:01:56:21 —> 00:02:01:20
Specifically, I am really into branding, web and UX/UI, but

31
00:02:01:21 —> 00:02:05:10
I mostly love just jumping in and becoming fully immersed

32
00:02:05:11 —> 00:02:07:12
in the project as a whole and

33
00:02:07:14 —> 00:02:10:26
exploring and discovering what the best solutions will be.

33
00:02:10:27 —> 00:02:15:00
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

34
00:02:15:02 —> 00:02:21:13
Apart from design, I really enjoy reading, I love blasting In Rainbows

35
00:02:21:15 —> 00:02:25:22
while I take a shower so I can sing along with Thom Yorke.

36
00:02:27:04 —> 00:02:30:02
I love heated seats, all year round

37
00:02:32:02 —> 00:02:37:03
and I also play keys, guitar and sing vocals in a local Ottawa band.

38
00:02:37:27 —> 00:02:41:21
The Haig is going on about 10 years.

39
00:02:41:22 —> 00:02:44:18
We're going on 10 years of being in a band together

40
00:02:44:19 —> 00:02:46:07
— we played Bluesfest once —

41
00:02:46:08 —> 00:02:50:00
so I just really can't wait 'til we can safely jam again.

42
00:02:50:12 —> 00:02:54:21
Well, I believe that's time, so as a parting message,

43
00:02:54:22 —> 00:02:58:08
I guess I'd like to say that Creative Mornings Ottawa is doing

44
00:02:58:09 —> 00:03:03:05
a giveaway and I would very much like a tote bag for my eventual outings. 

45
00:03:03:06 —> 00:03:07:22
I'd really like to say that Ottawa is creative and I'm really happy to be here.

46
00:03:08:16 —> 00:03:10:15
Thank you so much for joining me.
