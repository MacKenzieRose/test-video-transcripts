00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.011
[Intro]

2
00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.414
Hi and thank you for joining me.

3
00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:17.517
I'm Treawna and I washed my hair today

4
00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:21.748
just as a small courtesy and an example

5
00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.124
of how I like to go that extra mile.

6
00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.292
Ok, well what have you done today?

7
00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.130
No, no, it's been a rough year, so I do

8
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:32.800
like to celebrate even the small accomplishments.

9
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.248
I hope that wherever and whenever you're tuning

10
00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:37.000
in from that you're doing ok.

11
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.774
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

12
00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:44.244
Today I'm here to celebrate a marginally larger accomplishment

13
00:00:44.245 --> 00:00:48.732
of wrapping up my third year of Algonquin's Graphic Design Program.

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.286
100% of which was done from the comfort of my bed—office. My office.

15
00:00:54.287 --> 00:01:00.827
Speaking of threes, I believe this is my third adventure in post-secondary education.

16
00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:05.632
I attended the School of the Photographic Arts: Ottawa, which really helped

17
00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:08.568
open up the ability to express myself visually.

18
00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:13.340
Then after that, I studied nutrition, which taught me to properly

19
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:18.566
fuel and focus this restless mind! I think what tipped me off that

20
00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:23.102
graphic design might be next was the 8 hours I once spent making a

21
00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:26.619
pamphlet/infographic about the ketogenic diet

22
00:01:27.013 --> 00:01:28.354
in nutrition school.

23
00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:32.425
And no, there weren't any marks allocated for the visuals.

24
00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:36.549
[What is your unique selling point as a designer?]

25
00:01:36.898 --> 00:01:38.665
I do love to learn and create so,

26
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:43.269
what I appreciate most about design is the infinite ability to do both.

27
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:48.367
As a designer, my focus is research, empathy and translation.

28
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.879
I like to be highly detail oriented in each of these stages

29
00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:56.182
so we can produce meaningful work that speaks to the intended message.

30
00:01:56.546 --> 00:02:01.688
Specifically, I am really into branding, web and UX/UI, but

31
00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.360
I mostly love just jumping in and becoming fully immersed

32
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:07.370
in the project as a whole and

33
00:02:07.618 --> 00:02:10.864
exploring and discovering what the best solutions will be.

33
00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:15.000
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

34
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:21.374
Apart from design, I really enjoy reading, I love blasting In Rainbows

35
00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:26.112
while I take a shower so I can sing along with Thom Yorke.

36
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.483
I love heated seats, all year round

37
00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:37.390
and I also play keys, guitar, and sing vocals in a local Ottawa band.

38
00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:41.761
The Haig is going on about 10 years.

39
00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:44:18
We're going on 10 years of being in a band together

40
00:02:44.504 --> 00:02:46.244
— we played Bluesfest once —

41
00:02:46.245 --> 00:02:50.203
so I just really can't wait 'til we can safely jam again.

42
00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:54.675
Well, I believe that's time, so as a parting message,

43
00:02:54.676 --> 00:02:58.316
I guess I'd like to say that Creative Mornings Ottawa is doing

44
00:02:58.317 --> 00:03:03.182
a giveaway and I would very much like a tote bag for my eventual outings. 

45
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:07.687
I'd really like to say that Ottawa is creative and I'm really happy to be here.

46
00:03:08.387 --> 00:03:10.502
Thank you so much for joining me.

47
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.827
