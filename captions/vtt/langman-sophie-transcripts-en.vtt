Hi my name is Sophie Langman and I\'92m in my third year of graphic design at Algonquin college and this is a little bit about me.\

[What inspired you to purse graphic design?]\
\

\cb3 0;00;23;18 \'97> 0;00;29;25\cb4 \
When I was in the fourth grade I had an English teacher named Miss Tucker and she gave us an assignment to create a billboard and a logo,\
\
5\
\cb3 0;00;30;12 \'97> 0;00;37;00\cb4 \
this is the first time I\'92ve ever heard of graphic design and I\'92ve been saying I wanted to be a graphic designer ever since\
\
6\
\cb3 0;00;37;00 \'97> 0;00;41;24\cb4 \
after that I took a class called com-tech in high school which is where I first learned\
\
7\
\cb3 0;00;41;25 \'97> 0;00;47;26\cb4 \
all the Adobe software and really the basics of design and from there I found myself Algonquin.\
\
8\
\cb3 0;00;49;03 \'97> 0;00;52;19\cb4 \
Apparently Miss Tucker still uses my project as an example to this day though! \

[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from\
graphic design?]\
\
10\
\cb3 0;00;57;24 \'97> 0;01;03;14\cb4 \
I love theatre especially musical theatre other forms of art and fashion\
\
11\
\cb3 0;01;03;15 \'97> 0;01;08;01\cb4 \
which aren\'92t so far away from graphic design in the grand scheme of things but\
\
12\
\cb3 0;01;08;02 \'97> 0;01;12;05\cb4 \
I\'92m also very very passionate about environmentalism and sustainable living\
\
13\
\cb3 0;01;12;05 \'97> 0;01;16;27\cb4 \
something which I\'92d really love to incorporate into my design work.\
\
\cb3 14\
0;01;17;06 \'97> 0;01;21;02\
[what are some things you\'92ve done to adapt to the work/school from home life]\
\
15\
0;01;21;03 \'97> 0;01;26;16\
I found it was really important to have some semblance of a routine even if I didn\'92t have somewhere I physically needed to be\
\
16\
0;01;26;17 \'97> 0;01;31;26\
and then also because I\'92m a very very social person I found it was really important for me\
\
17\
0;01;31;27 \'97> 0;01;42;07\
to find ways to connect with my friends my peers my coworkers virtually and when I started I started doing that more often I really found that helped with self motivation.\
