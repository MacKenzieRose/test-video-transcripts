Hi my name is Sophie Langman and I’m in my third year of graphic design at Algonquin college and this is a little bit about me.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.110
[What inspired you to purse graphic design?]

4
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.250
When I was in the fourth grade I had an English teacher named Miss Tucker and she gave us an assignment to create a billboard and a logo,

5
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.000
this is the first time I’ve ever heard of graphic design and I’ve been saying I wanted to be a graphic designer ever since.

6
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.240
after that I took a class called com-tech in high school which is where I first learned

7
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.260
all the Adobe software and really the basics of design and from there I found myself Algonquin.

8
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.190
Apparently Miss Tucker still uses my project as an example to this day though!

[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from
graphic design?]

10
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.140
I love theatre especially musical theatre other forms of art and fashion

11
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.010
which aren’t so far away from graphic design in the grand scheme of things but

12
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.050
I’m also very very passionate about environmentalism and sustainable living 

13
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.270
something which I’d really love to incorporate into my design work.

14
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.020
[what are some things you’ve done to adapt to the work/school from home life]

15
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.160
I found it was really important to have some semblance of a routine even if I didn’t have somewhere I physically needed to be

16
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.260
and then also because I’m a very very social person I found it was really important for me

17
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:42.070
to find ways to connect with my friends my peers my coworkers virtually and when I started I started doing that more often I really found that helped with self motivation.
