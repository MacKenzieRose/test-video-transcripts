[What inspires you  as a graphic designer?]

2
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.200
Asking me what influences my design is like asking what influences the tide

3
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.200
Like asking what influences the sun and the moon

4
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.000
The world turning on its axis

5
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
An apple falling from a tree.

6
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
Asking me what influences my design is like asking a bird how itâ€™s able to fly

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.500
A fish how it is able to swim

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Or a horse how it is able to exist at all.

9
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.000
The answer is the same every time.

10
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.000
What influences my design?

11
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
Everything.
