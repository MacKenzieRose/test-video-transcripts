[Intro]

2
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.100
[What designers, brands or websites do you admire?]

3
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:23.010
Paula Scher is one of my favourite graphic designers, her work with typography is absolutely amazing. 

4
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:31.140
She was one of the few female designers that made a name for herself, so I am hoping one day to be at her level.

5
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.200
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

6
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.210
I really enjoyed motion graphics, it was a whole new system for me but I really loved it. 

7
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.050
I always had an admiration for animation and videography ever since I was a kid.

8
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.250
[What is your favourite colour? Pantone or hex?]

9
00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.140
This is a hard question, because a lot of my work is very colorful. But if I had to choose, it would be blue. 

10
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.000
[Where do you see yourself in 5 years?]

11
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.260
Well I would have my own studio business, a sort of one stop shop for clients. 

12
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.080
We would offer photography, print, graphic design and motion graphics.

13
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:28.190
I also want to be a professor that teaches graphic design, I enjoy helping people and to teach that to the next generation would be amazing.

14
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.220
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

15
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.160
Mine is Photoshop, I use it all the time. I create a lot of digital art work with the brushes I have 

16
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:48.090
and I am also a photographer so I do a lot of photo editing for my pictures.

17
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.190
