[What Inspired You to Pursue Graphic Design?]

4
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.300
A little fun fact about me, I knew absolutely nothing about graphic design. I learned about it in a span of about three days, 

5
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.060
and I was like this really intrigued me.

6
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.150
So I threw together a portfolio really quickly, and I told myself, okay if I get in then this is meant to be.

7
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.180
This is my passion. This is my career. 

8
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.420
Sure enough, two days later I got in and I was like alright, this is it. And here we are today.

In five years, hopefully I'm not in a pandemic. That we're not in a pandemic. 

15
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.300
I'd love to be probably travelling around different countries and bringing my design, and learning new experiences.
