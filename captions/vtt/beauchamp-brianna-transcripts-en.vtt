[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

4
0:00:22:02 - 0:00:25:12
So, my favourite class, I'd say was probably concept sketching with Andrea.

5
0:00:25:12 - 0:00:30:19
Just because it was right up my alley and it was always a class I looked forward to.

6
0:00:30:19 - 0:00:40:02
I do also have to mention though Typography class with Greg because although it was really difficult, I did really learn a lot.

7
0:00:40:02 - 0:00:48:17
And not to mention Angie in our Graphic Design class because she really prepared us for the real world with out in-class presentations.

[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

9
0:00:53:21 - 0:01:02:05
My favourite adobe application. I'd have to say hands down Illustrator's my favourite.

10
0:01:02:05 - 0:01:09:10
I use it for as many things as I can before opening up any other application honestly.

[What is your favourite colour?]

11
0:01:13:13 - 0:01:22:05
Favourite colour. I wouldn't say I have one specific favourite colour.

12
0:01:22:05 - 0:01:28:07
I do have a love for any shade of teal, pink, or red however.

13
0:01:28:07 - 0:01:38:09
You know, teal makes me think of being at a beach, you know, feet in the sand, pink is just fun, and red has like this attitude that I just love.

[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

15
0:01:43:01 - 0:01:46:00
Passions and hobbies.

16
0:01:46:00 - 0:01:55:00
In my spare time I like to read, I like to bake, draw, and of course Netflix binge.

17
0:01:55:00 - 0:02:00:10
I am also an assistant manager at a restaurant so that takes up most of my time as well.

0:02:00:10 - 0:02:05:03
[What is your favourite font?]

19
0:02:05:03 - 0:02:11:09
My favourite font would have to be anything scripty honestly.

20
0:02:11:09 - 0:02:18:11
I feel like they have so much personality. They can be sassy, they can be simple, they can be cute.

21
0:02:18:11 - 0:02:25:15
Only problem with script fonts is that you have to know when to use them and when not to use them.
