[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

4
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.120
So, my favourite class, I'd say was probably concept sketching with Andrea.

5
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.190
Just because it was right up my alley and it was always a class I looked forward to.

6
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:40.020
I do also have to mention though Typography class with Greg because although it was really difficult, I did really learn a lot.

7
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.170
And not to mention Angie in our Graphic Design class because she really prepared us for the real world with out in-->class presentations.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.210
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

9
00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:02.050
My favourite adobe application. I'd have to say hands down Illustrator's my favourite.

10
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.100
I use it for as many things as I can before opening up any other application honestly.

10
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.130
[What is your favourite colour?]

11
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:22.050
Favourite colour. I wouldn't say I have one specific favourite colour.

12
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.070
I do have a love for any shade of teal, pink, or red however.

13
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:38.090
You know, teal makes me think of being at a beach, you know, feet in the sand, pink is just fun, and red has like this attitude that I just love.

14
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.010
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

15
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.000
Passions and hobbies.

16
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
In my spare time I like to read, I like to bake, draw, and of course Netflix binge.

17
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.100
I am also an assistant manager at a restaurant so that takes up most of my time as well.

18
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.030
[What is your favourite font?]

19
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.090
My favourite font would have to be anything scripty honestly.

20
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.110
I feel like they have so much personality. They can be sassy, they can be simple, they can be cute.

21
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.150
Only problem with script fonts is that you have to know when to use them and when not to use them.
