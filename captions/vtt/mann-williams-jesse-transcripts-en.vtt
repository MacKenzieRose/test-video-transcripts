[What influences your work as a designer?]

3
00:00:15:10 —> 00:00:17:14I get a lot of inspiration from traditional animation.

4
00:00:17:15 —> 00:00:20:00
I love that a lot of texture and grit into my motion pieces.

5
00:00:20:01 —> 00:00:22:00
It just gives it that tactile feel and makes it

6
00:00:22:03 —> 00:00:24:13
[feel] like it was all done by hand and not generated from a computer.

7
00:00:24:14 —> 00:00:28:13[What is your favourite font?]

8
00:00:28:14 —> 00:00:30:10One of my current favourite fonts is New Spirit.

9
00:00:30:11 —> 00:00:32:10
It's a very round serif font that brings a lot of character

10
00:00:32:11 —> 00:00:33:10
to certain designs.

11
00:00:33:20 —> 00:00:37:08
I don't use a lot of serif fonts, I always gravitate to sans-serif ones,

12
00:00:37:15 —> 00:00:40:07
but whenever I want to switch things up, New Spirit is always my go-to.

13
00:00:40:18 —> 00:00:43:21[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]14
00:00:43:22 —> 00:00:45:20
Well, I've always loved drawing and creating things.

15
00:00:45:21 —> 00:00:47:19
I remember the first time I'd heard about graphic design

16
00:00:47:20 —> 00:00:48:23
was around [the] seventh or eighth grade.

17
00:00:49:00 —> 00:00:50:16
We had to do this project on careers,

18
00:00:50:17 —> 00:00:51:22
where we took this online quiz,

19
00:00:51:23 -> 00:00:54:23
which asked us a whole bunch of questions pertaining to various jobs.

20
00:00:55:08 —> 00:00:58:13
After the quiz was done, it generated a long list of possible jobs that

21
00:00:58:14 —> 00:01:00:20
it thought best suited our personalities.

22
00:01:00:20 —> 00:01:04:10
A graphic designer was high on my list and I've just pursued it ever since.
