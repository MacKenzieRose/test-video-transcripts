[Intro]

2
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.250
[What is your favourite font? What font describes your personality?]

3
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:25.020
So I seem to have a favourite font or colour, like every six months to a year. Um, right now my favorite font is Petrona.

4
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:35.220
So it's a serif, it's professional yet modern. It's got a little bit of personality. Uh, it's variable. So, um, very easy to work with as well. 

5
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.220
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

6
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:49.260
So I wasn't necessarily inspired to pursue graphic design, it’s something that I kind of was actually pushed into by someone I know.

7
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:58.240
I had been wanting to go back to school and I had a little bit of history taking psychology and business, and it just wasn't for me.

8
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.040
So I ended up working in retail management for quite a few years and then finally applied for graphic design.

9
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:14.040
So even going into it, I, I still wasn't really sure about it, but after only a few classes, I started to understand what graphic design truly was about

10
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.200
and the ability to solve problems and create purposeful design. And, um, I'm really happy to have found it. 

11
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.040
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

12
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:35.280
I do enjoy a lot of different, you know, hobbies and passions. Um, I like doing stuff outside, uh, like gardening and, uh, this year I picked up cross country skiing.

13
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:46.110
I'm also really excited for the gyms to open back up ‘cause I had really gotten into, um, weightlifting. Um, I like cooking and making healthy recipes.

14
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.080
Um, but I guess the thing that is maybe most design-related is I really like nature and macro photography.

15
00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:01.050
So I just think it's nice to capture the the really small details and, um, the things that maybe a lot of people miss.

16
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.040
[What influences your work as a designer?]

17
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:14.180
On a surface level, I'd say I'm inspired by uh, other designers work that I see on Dribble, or Behance, or Instagram, even.

18
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.200
I think there's a lot of really great and influential work out there. Um, but as a whole, I'm influenced by the designs that I see out in the wild,

19
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:31.040
um, from a, you know, user experience standpoint, when you’re using something or going somewhere and it just, there's a friction point.

20
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:40.050
And now for me, I'm able to understand that that's a friction point. And so I catch myself thinking about how it could be better designed.

21
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.120
And, uh, so I do base some of my projects around those types of things. And then, um, on the other hand, you know,

22
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.280
you see good design out there and you take note of why it's a good design, why it's worked and just appreciate it for what it is.

23
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.240
