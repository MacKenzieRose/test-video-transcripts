[Intro]

2
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.100
Hi there! I’m Alison Doyle and I’m a third year graphic design student at algonquin college. 

3
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:27.200
Everybody else has been taking like 30-40 takes so I decided for you guys, specifically, to try to just do this in one take. 

4
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:36.150
So it might get a little awkward, with long pauses. I want to see how it goes and this way I will be answering questions naturally.

5
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.030
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

6
00:00:44.080 --> 00:01:01.080
I guess my favourite class in the graphic design program has to be graphic design. I love focusing more on branding and illustrations and packaging. You know? 

7
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.080
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

8
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.200
My other passions that I have aside from graphic design that you will see if you go to my personal website are;

9
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.090
eggs Benedict -because who doesn't love a good eggs benny-


10
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.000
Harry Potter because that's self-explanatory and makeup 

11
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.150
which I have on. So you can see those are kind of like my little hobbies. 

12
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.190
I also like reading -as you can see from all the books in the background- and going on forest walks with my dogs. 

13
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.160
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

14
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.200
My favourite Adobe application has to be it's a tie between illustrator and InDesign.

15
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:54.060
I really like the fact that I can lay stuff out with a nice little grid but then illustrator kind of offers you a little bit more freedom when it comes to design.

16
00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.140
Whereas indesign is a little bit more structurally sound when creating something. I guess I would have to say illustrator.

17
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.010
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

18
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.130
What inspired me to pursue graphic design, well it's like, I hate to sound cliche

19
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.140
but it's one of those situations where if you know, like as a kid I did a lot of art.

20
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:25.080
I kind of stopped for a little bit got more into graffiti and then kind of progressed through there doing pieces at house of paint. 

21
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:40.230
I ended up going to business school a couple years ago and I thought that it would just be great to combine the two because eventually I do want to freestyle

22
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.170
freelance

23
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.110
but I won't be free-styling for you today. 

24
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.200
[Where do you see yourself in 5 years?]

25
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.110
Where do I see myself in 5 years? 

26
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:59.190
Well, right now I've got some money in stocks and my partner and I plan on moving to Cancun in around five years, so that's kind of where I see myself.

27
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:10.110
Living in a place where there isn't snow because snow is cold and Mexico is hot and it has beaches and I like swimming.


28
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.010
Wow this has been

29
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:22.070
a very good video in my opinion I’m so glad that you got to see it because you got to see me without preparing for any questions,

30
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.000
sort of like an interview so you like got to see the real me I suppose. 

31
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.180
I love graphic design. I love type. I love illustration and I love branding.

32
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:41.160
Eventually, down the line, what are the things that I really hope to work on is packaging design for something like kombucha drink, for example.

33
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.190
That's something that I just really want to do as a goal as a designer. 

34
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.060
Yeah, I mean, I suppose it was awkward, that's for sure. 

35
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.230
I'm looking forward to meeting all of you and if you'd like to schedule a time to talk I would love that and I hope that you guys have a lovely day!

36
00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.070
Bye! 

37
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.070
