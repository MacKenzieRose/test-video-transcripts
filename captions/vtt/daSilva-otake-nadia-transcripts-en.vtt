Well, I spend most of my 2020 dressed like this and working like this. 

2
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.200
and designing beautiful things dressed like this, but of course, because we need to be professional.

3
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.000
I decided that for zoom calls, I should be like, [snap fingers]. 

4
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.150
Hi there. My name is Nadia Otake and I write upside down.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.100
And this is the most weird way to start a video, but I just want to give you a little glimpse of who I am

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.500
so you get to know me a little bit more.

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.100
I am graduating as a graphic designer. And I just want to share a little bit about why I choose this program.

8
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.300
I'm a photographer by trade. I am born and raised in Brazil, travel the world

9
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.200
and got to meet a lot of human beings from different races, religions, beliefs.

10
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.100
I love humans. I'm always being visual. I always loved to create things visually.

11
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.100
One of my mottos is 'to bring ideas to life in life into ideas' and human beings are a machine of ideas,

12
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.200
but some of them don't know how to reflect that visually. So that's where I come.

13
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.000
I want to do this through Branding, Print, UX, UI, and Motion.

14
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.300
And I'm still learning some of the craft, but I feel like I want to get better at it

15
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.200
and do things with excellence and beauty to solve people's problems. 

16
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.250
How I see myself in five years, I am pursuing to be an art or creative director

17
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.100
and reasoning is because I love people and I love the process of design.

18
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.200
I don't love just creating things. I love like how you get from ideation to completion

19
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.150
and you need people to do that. And I feel like the best apps or best designs were made as a team.

20
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.100
So I know that I'm not good in everything, but I am very good in finding people that are good in everything.

21
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.000
So I just want to find those people and build great teams and just get from here, there. And solve people's problems. 

22
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.100
I think I'm inspired by beauty. I'm inspired everywhere I go. I'm a thinker.

23
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.200
So I'm constantly thinking about people's behaviors. I'm observing people as a photographer.

24
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:37.300
I learned to observe people and seeing their struggles and seeing like things that could improve their lives.

25
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.100
So I'm constantly thinking, how can I do. To improve people's lives.

26
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.200
Agencies that I would love love to work with are open-minded ones are the ones that are looking to the future

27
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and they are trying to understand the times I feel like like-minded agencies in a sense that we can,

28
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.250
colab and we can create things, not just for the sake of it, but then we can think about how

29
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that can improve people's lives and add value to them.

30
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:23.000
I'm a very colorful person, as you can see here, I love colors and I love color coding things. 

31
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.000
So I just want to say thank you for your time somewhere here, somewhere in this thing,

32
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:37.000
you will find a little glimpse of my work and if you like it, Also somewhere in this website,

33
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.000
you will find buttons or things that you can click to connect with me.

34
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.000
Thank you for your time. And I appreciate it if you're still here. I appreciate it. Thank you. Have a wonderful day.
