[Intro]

2
00:00:12.00 --> 00:00:20.29
Hey, I’m Jen Power and I’m a scientific graphic designer. I have a M.Sc. with a background in molecular biology and cancer research. 

3
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.130
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?] 

4
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.210
My main inspiration to pursue graphic design was to communicate scientific concepts effectively and fight misinformation and science fearmongering.

5
00:00:32.210--> 00:00:37.060 
Science is so amazing, so I’m just trying to convince everyone else that it’s cool. 

6
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.190
[What is your unique selling point as a designer?] 

7
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.220
I’m the sole grad from this cohort that is specializing in scientific graphic design, which is probably the most unique thing about my work.

8
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:55.150 
Given my background in research, I approach my work in a very analytical and strategic manner, which allows me to excel in the design world.

9
00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:04.040 
I’m an incredibly efficient worker and I pride myself on my time management skills. While being in college full-time, I was able to balance working two,

10
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.250 
and at one point three jobs, while still completing all my work on time and to a high standard of quality. 

11
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.080
[Where do you see yourself in 5 years?] 

12
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.050
In 5 years, I see myself working at either a scientific communication agency or freelancing, 

13
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.120
where I’d be ideally creating designs for both scientific and lay audiences. 

14
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.100
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?] 

15
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.260
Aside from graphic design, my other interests include music, specifically genres like post-metal, new wave, and sometimes disco,

16
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:46.260 
I love watching classic horror movies, and I always have an intense desire to know everything, so I enjoy memorizing random facts for trivia. 

17
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.100
[What is your favourite colour?]

18
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.030
As someone who only wears black, I’d have to say my favourite colour is (Pantone Black C).

19
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.010
