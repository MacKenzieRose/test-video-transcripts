[Intro]

2
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.000
Hi there. My name is Tasmyn Clark and I'm part of generation adaptation 2021.

3
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:27.060
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

4
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.270
I joined the graphic design program because I wanted to find my spot in the game community.

5
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.130
I wanted to develop a game since I was kid, but I really didn't know if I enjoy coding more. 

6
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.170
If I enjoyed doing art, I wasn't confident in myself on anything. 

7
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.070
So when I joined the graphic design program, it was to learn more.

8
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.170
If I want to be an artist, if I enjoyed coding because the graphic design program offered both.

9
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.110
And then I've just found myself like in graphic design. 

10
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.180
I appreciate that I now have the skills if I want to go back to making games, 

11
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.060
but I definitely have found a love and interest in making motion work and graphic work and especially small business branding. 

12
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.290
And it's overall I've gained my confidence. 

13
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.220
So if I wanted to go back to the games, I have the confidence to do so, 

14
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.250
but I've definitely been really enjoying just by work as a designer.

15
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.060
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

16
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.070
I love motion graphics. 

17
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.150
It is by far my favourite thing to do. 

18
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.230
I love the fact that I have a huge variety between, making commercials to 

19
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.160
even just making small shows, even just adding minor animations to a character for say a video game. 

20
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.110
I love what it's introduced me to and the things I'll be able to do with it. 

21
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.130
I loved animation growing up as a kid. I loved Disney, Pixar, even animes. 

22
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.140
I think the best part now is I still love animation. 

23
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.220
I still watch like my little pony and stuff like that. 

24
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.010
And this is my way of being able to kind of live as an animator without only having animation. 

25
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.200
I can still then take the skills that I've learned from this program and apply them in other things. 

26
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.170
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

27
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.040
I have one major hobby outside of the graphic design program 

28
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.150
and it is snakes. 

29
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.140
This here is Muffin. He was my first snake. 

30
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.220
I got him in the first year of the graphic design program 

31
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.250
and I never had owned reptiles before that.

32
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.040
And now I'm up to 19 of them. 

33
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.170
I have started a small breeding project called Nerdy Noods, where I breed and 

34
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.220
educate people on snakes and to show that they're actually quite nice. 

35
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.220
They're very gentle. They're very sweet. As you could see, he's just chilling with me. 

36
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.020
This is what he usually does while we're working. 

37
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.100
He's very calm. He's very beautiful too. 

38
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.210
I love using him as references and he's a really good model for some of my videos. 

39
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.220
If you look at my portfolio, you'll actually see him in some of my videos. 

40
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.240
There is going to be a bit of a jump cut here because I also wanted to show off Scylla. 

41
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.080
I bred Scylla myself back in 2020. She was part of my first ever clutch. 

42
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.080
She's also a Ball Python like Muffin, but she has a different pattern and she's obviously a baby. 

43
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.110
So she's much smaller than him. 

44
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.190
Kind of going past by infatuation with snakes though hobbies wise, I also really enjoy games, 

45
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.100
video games. I definitely was addicted to Animal Crossing during 2020, when that came out. 

46
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.000
Pretty much, most of my 2020, it was Animal Crossing. 

47
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.280
I also enjoy board games, you know, good old monopoly as well as some other board games, 

48
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.270
card games, like Genesis, Magic the Gathering, and tabletop games. 

49
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.100
I'd be getting more into that. I've been playing DnD and Pathfinder. 

50
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.140
Those have been some really nice new addictions.

51
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.050
I appreciate you taking the time to get to know me.

52
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.060
Again, my name is Tasmyn Clark. 

53
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.120
I am a motion designer and part of generation adaptation, 2021.

54
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.030
