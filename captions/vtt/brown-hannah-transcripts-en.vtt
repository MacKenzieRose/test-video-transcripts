Hello, my name is Hannah, and welcome to my little corner of our website.

3
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.004
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

4
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:27.027
I think I always had this brewing. Now that I'm here, I’ve sort of looked back at when I was growing up, 

5
00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:35.010
and I used to design fonts in notepads, and I designed my first logo when I was in grade five. 

6
00:00:35.012 --> 00:00:42.000
Um, it was horrendous! It was a basketball with some flames, very original, but I was very proud of it. 

7
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.028
It was for like a sports club team thing in elementary school.

8
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:50.000
I considered doing it right out of high school and actually looked at Algonquin college specifically. 

9
00:00:50.009 --> 00:01:01.005
But, um, I was fortunate to be able to go to university and get that experience and, you know, be able to pursue other passions and learn about them and grow in that way. 

10
00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:10.023
And so I did that and I enjoyed it a lot, but I don't think I really had a plan necessarily after university. 

11
00:01:10.024 --> 00:01:22.010
And so I worked a few varying different jobs, and noticed after a while that in every job I had, I was trying to do some sort of art themed, something? 

12
00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:28.013
Like I, I worked, um, at a retail shop and was painting displays in the windows. 

13
00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:37.010
I worked at a charity and was given a graphic novel project, which I absolutely loved and then was, you know, making postcards and doing all these things. 

14
00:01:37.024 --> 00:01:44.012
And, you know, after a while I sort of noticed, okay, so. This is the thing that I clearly want to be doing with my time. 

15
00:01:44.018 --> 00:01:47.026
So maybe I should just commit to it and do it already.

16
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.024
And so that's what I did! And I'm very happy that I made that choice. 

17
00:01:53.025 --> 00:02:00.010
Because I feel simpatico with my younger self who was trying to tell me that this is what I should be doing. 

18
00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:04.017
And I, uh, I've made it here in the end, so that's good.

19
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:08.011
[What does graphic design mean to you?]

20
00:02:08.018 --> 00:02:11.005
I really like that it gives you the chance to be clever. 

21
00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:24.004
Obviously I love the artistic aspect and the communication piece, because I think that it's nice that there's sort of a way that we can write our own universal language in the visuals and things that we come up with. 

22
00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:26.028
And it's really fun to be able to share that with clients too. 

23
00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:31.026
And you know, you spend so much time looking at something and then when it finally clicks and you get that last puzzle piece in. 

24
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.020
It just is so satisfying.

25
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.028
I also just appreciate that, you know, everyone needs it? 

26
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.000
You can do it from anywhere, um, and it, yeah, it really is just sort of a universal sort of thing.

27
00:02:42.013 --> 00:02:51.021
On a personal side, I really appreciate that it allows me to pursue the interests and values that I have with the skill I have to offer. 

28
00:02:52.004 --> 00:03:03.016
It's important to me that I can do this thing that I enjoy and have the skills to do, to support causes and other pieces that I really think are important.

29
00:03:04.028 --> 00:03:09.006
I hope you like what you see here, and I hope that you enjoy what my peers are up to as well! 

30
00:03:09.016 --> 00:03:15.000
And, uh, yeah, just thanks so much for coming to our virtual grad show, and, uh, yeah. 

31
00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:16.001
I hope you have a lovely day!

32
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.010
*Singing* Let’s hope this one is better!
