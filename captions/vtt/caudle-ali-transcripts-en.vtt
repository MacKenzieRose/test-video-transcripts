[Intro]

2
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.240
Hi, my name is Ali Caudle and I am a Graphic Designer. 

3
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.050
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

4
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.140
What inspired me to pursue graphic design was essentially having doodled my entire way through high school 

5
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.290
and then finding out that I could actually get paid to do that. 

6
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.010
[What are some great things you’ve done to adapt to the work/school from home life?]

7
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:47.110
The best thing that I have done to adapt to at-home school has been

8
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.190
stealing this office chair from my significant other

9
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.160
so that I avoid neck pain. It's really, that's been the greatest thing that I've done.

10
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.040
[What is your dream company/studio to work with?]

11
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:13.080
I am really looking forward to finding a studio or company that is extremely collaborative, imaginative, fun, 

12
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.100
and that's where I would like to stay and grow– in an environment like that.

13
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.230
[What brands do you admire?]

14
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.230
My favourite brand is Sofia Zakia Jewelry. 

15
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:40.000
I've never seen anyone else create jewelry like her. She takes from astrology, history, 

16
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.110
mythology, and she just creates these magical little pieces, and I 

17
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:58.200
I am incredibly inspired by her work, and I try to put as much imagination and creativity, in everything  I do.

18
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.220
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

19
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.150
My favourite class to take in the graphic design course was definitely motion graphics 

20
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:20.220
because that was something I had never tried outside of Algonquin. Never anything I had thought I would be interested in, 

21
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.120
and I've had, I think, the most fun developing my motion graphics skills.

22
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.190
[Where do you see yourself in 5 years?]

23
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:38.240
In 5 years, I see myself nicely settled in a collaborative and fun environment.

24
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.190
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

25
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:52.070
My other hobbies are singing, acting, dancing, painting, 

26
00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:02.280
basically just creative stuff so I always knew I would end up down the creative path when it came to my career.

27
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.270
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

28
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:16.110
My favourite Adobe app is definitely Photoshop because, just, what you can do in there is endless, 

29
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:25.050
and I just, I don't think I'll stop learning the new things that I can do in there.

30
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.200
[What does graphic design mean to you?]

31
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:37.260
To me, graphic design is the organized chaos of story telling. 

32
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:47.000
It's the act of taking someones heart and soul and translating that into art.

33
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.250
