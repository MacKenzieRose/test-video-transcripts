[Intro]

2
0;00;12;160 --> 0;00;16;240
Hi, my name is Ali Caudle and I am a Graphic Designer. 

3
0;00;17;200 --> 0;00;20;050
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

4
0;00;20;230 --> 0;00;28;140
What inspired me to pursue graphic design was essentially having doodled my entire way through high school 

5
0;00;28;140 --> 0;00;32;290
and then finding out that I could actually get paid to do that. 

6
0;00;34;00 --> 0;00;37;010
[What are some great things you’ve done to adapt to the work/school from home life?]

7
0;00;37;190 --> 0;00;47;110
The best thing that I have done to adapt to at-home school has been

8
0;00;47;110 --> 0;00;52;190
stealing this office chair from my significant other

9
0;00;52;190 --> 0;00;59;160
so that I avoid neck pain. It's really, that's been the greatest thing that I've done.

10
0;01;00;190 --> 0;01;03;04
[What is your dream company/studio to work with?]

11
0;01;03;220 --> 0;01;13;080
I am really looking forward to finding a studio or company that is extremely collaborative, imaginative, fun, 

12
0;01;14;060 --> 0;01;21;100
and that's where I would like to stay and grow– in an environment like that.

13
0;01;22;050 --> 0;01;24;230
[What brands do you admire?]

14
0;01;25;110 --> 0;01;30;230
My favourite brand is Sofia Zakia Jewelry. 

15
0;01;30;230 --> 0;01;40;000
I've never seen anyone else create jewelry like her. She takes from astrology, history, 

16
0;01;40;000 --> 0;01;48;110
mythology, and she just creates these magical little pieces, and I 

17
0;01;48;110 --> 0;01;58;200
I am incredibly inspired by her work, and I try to put as much imagination and creativity, in everything  I do.

18
0;01;59;190 --> 0;02;02;220
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

19
0;02;03;100 --> 0;02;10;150
My favourite class to take in the graphic design course was definitely motion graphics 

20
0;02;10;150 --> 0;02;20;220
because that was something I had never tried outside of Algonquin. Never anything I had thought I would be interested in, 

21
0;02;20;220 --> 0;02;26;120
and I've had, I think, the most fun developing my motion graphics skills.

22
0;02;27;040 --> 0;02;29;190
[Where do you see yourself in 5 years?]

23
0;02;30;070 --> 0;02;38;240
In 5 years, I see myself nicely settled in a collaborative and fun environment.

24
0;02;39;150 --> 0;02;42;190
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

25
0;02;43;070 --> 0;02;52;070
My other hobbies are singing, acting, dancing, painting, 

26
0;02;52;070 --> 0;03;02;280
basically just creative stuff so I always knew I would end up down the creative path when it came to my career.

27
0;03;03;240 --> 0;03;06;270
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

28
0;03;07;160 --> 0;03;16;110
My favourite Adobe app is definitely Photoshop because, just, what you can do in there is endless, 

29
0;03;16;110 --> 0;03;25;050
and I just, I don't think I'll stop learning the new things that I can do in there.

30
0;03;26;030 --> 0;03;28;200
[What does graphic design mean to you?]

31
0;03;29;090 --> 0;03;37;260
To me, graphic design is the organized chaos of story telling. 

32
0;03;37;260 --> 0;03;47;000
It's the act of taking someones heart and soul and translating that into art.

33
0;03;47;160 --> 0;03;51;250
