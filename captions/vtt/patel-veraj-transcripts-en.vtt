00:00:22.08 --> 00:00:27.07
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

4
00:00:27.07 --> 00:00:31.09
My favourite class was graphic define itself because 

5
00:00:31.09 --> 00:00:38.17
it taught me a lot about the industry itself and how it worked, as well

6
00:00:38.17 --> 00:00:49.13 
Graphic design taught graphic design class taught me how to, uh, become a better designer and look, and improve my skillset.

7
00:00:49.13 --> 00:00:54.01
[Where do you see yourself in 5 years?]

8
00:00:54.01 --> 00:01:01.20
Uh, personally, I would see myself working in a freelance industry or in a company itself.

9
00:01:01.20 --> 00:01:14.00
I also had the idea of going back to school to get a, another business degree or another art degree to improve my skills, skillset itself, passions, hobbies.

10
00:01:14.00 --> 00:01:19.01
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

I am an avid video gamer. I also scurried the internet looking at. Odd. I think their information that I want to learn,

[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

00:01:39.19 --> 00:01:45.01
I love Photoshop, in the past I used to work with Photoshop, learning about it,

15
00:01:45.01 --> 00:01:49.20 
but my skill and knowledge was minimal going into graphic design program,

16
00:01:49.20 --> 00:01:58.00 
I've learned more about it, about Photoshop itself then the four years I've worked with photoshop previously,

17
00:01:58.20 --> 00:02:02.01
there's so much you can do with Photoshop itself.
