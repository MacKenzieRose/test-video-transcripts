00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.090
My favourite class was graphic define itself because 

5
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.170
it taught me a lot about the industry itself and how it worked, as well

6
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:49.130 
Graphic design taught graphic design class taught me how to, uh, become a better designer and look, and improve my skillset.

[Where do you see yourself in 5 years?]

8
00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.200
Uh, personally, I would see myself working in a freelance industry or in a company itself.

9
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:14.000
I also had the idea of going back to school to get a, another business degree or another art degree to improve my skills, skillset itself, passions, hobbies.

I love Photoshop, in the past I used to work with Photoshop, learning about it,

15
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.200 
but my skill and knowledge was minimal going into graphic design program,

16
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:58.000 
I've learned more about it, about Photoshop itself then the four years I've worked with photoshop previously,

17
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.010
there's so much you can do with Photoshop itself.
