[Intro]

2
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.190
[What is your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

3
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.18
My favourite classes from the graphic design program are tied between web dev and motion graphics.

4
00:00:21.19 --> 00:00:28:13
For web dev, I loved the problem-solving aspect of coding and I really wanted to code websites from the very beginning

5
00:00:28:14 --> 00:00:32:16
that’s kind of what brought me into the graphic design program, so I really really loved that class. 

6
00:00:32.16 --> 00:00:37:24
I loved motion graphics, I had never really thought of animating graphics before

7
00:00:37:25 --> 00:00:44:10
so being exposed to that and learning basic animation principles and bringing graphics to life was very very interesting to me.

8
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.250
[Where do you see yourself in 5 years?]

9
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.07
In the next five years I hope to see myself still in the government. 

10
00:00:52.08 --> 00:00:59.12
I’m currently on route to being bridged in full time with Public Safety doing analysis as well as graphics for them. 

11
00:00:59.13 --> 00:01:02.07
So hopefully in five years I will be moving up the ranks there.

12
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.130
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

13
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10:03
My other passions include hockey and skating. 

14
00:01:10:04 --> 00:01:15:29
I’m a past university athlete from Concordia University and I played on their women’s hockey team. 

15
00:01:16:00 --> 00:01:22:03
So hockey is always a big part of my life and I still play to this day. Hopefully I can get back on the ice soon.
