[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?] 

3
00:00:15:10 —> 00:00:17:14
I've been drawing as a hobby for as long as I can remember

4
00:00:17:15 —> 00:00:19:26
and with that passion I wanted to pursue animation

5
00:00:19:27 —> 00:00:21:09
all throughout high school.

6
00:00:21:16 —> 00:00:24:14
Although in grade 12, I had a graphic design co-op,

7
00:00:24:15 —> 00:00:26:07
which then made me realize that graphic design

8
00:00:26:08 —> 00:00:27:19
was a better fit for me and it was what I

9
00:00:27:20 —> 00:00:28:22
wanted to do in the future.

10
00:00:29:02 —> 00:00:32:07
So overall, what inspired me to pursue graphic design

11
00:00:32:08 —> 00:00:35:22
was my love for drawing and just my overall love for creating. 

12
00:00:36:02 —> 00:00:39:14
What is your dream company/studio to work with?]

13
0:00:39:15 —> 00:00:41:01
I've always been a huge fan of Disney.

14
00:00:41:02 —> 00:00:43:22
Their movies and shows have always been my favourite so,

15
00:00:43:23 —> 00:00:45:24
if I could work with them in any way, shape, or form,

16
00:00:45:25 —> 00:00:47:02
it would be a dream come true.

17
00:00:47:23 —> 00:00:49:15
As for graphic design studios specifically,

18
00:00:49:16 —> 00:00:53:15
I would love to work with Doublenaut in Toronto or Cinnamon Toast here in Ottawa. 

19
00:00:53:16 —> 00:00:57:13
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

20
00:00:57:14 —> 00:01:00:22
My favourite class all throughout the graphic design program was motion graphics

21
00:01:00:23 —> 00:01:03:14
because it was all new material and I learned a lot in that class.

22
00:01:03:15 —> 00:01:07:06
Also, it gave me a chance to do some animation, which was what I

23
00:01:07:07 —> 00:01:08:10
originally planned on doing so

24
00:01:08:11 —> 00:01:10:18
it was nice to have a taste of that area in design.

25
00:01:10:19 —> 00:01:14:02
What is your favourite colour?]

26
00:01:14:03 —> 00:01:15:27
My favourite color is yellow and it always has been

27
00:01:15:28 —> 00:01:18:06
for as long as I can remember. My favourite shades

28
00:01:18:07 —> 00:01:20:06
are the brighter yellows because they're so fun and happy. 

29
00:01:20:28 —> 00:01:24:22
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

30
00:01:24:23 —> 00:01:26:26
In my free time, I love to spend time with my family

31
00:01:26:27 —> 00:01:29:04
and something that we love to do together is go camping.

32
00:01:29:05 —> 00:01:32:17
It's really nice to spend time outside and go for a bike ride or go to the beach.

33
00:01:32:18 —> 00:01:35:26
I've also started doing embroidery last year, which has been really fun

34
00:01:35:27 —> 00:01:38:10
and it's been nice to learn something new.
