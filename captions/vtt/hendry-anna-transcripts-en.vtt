[Intro]

2
00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:15.315
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?] 

3
00:00:15.413 --> 00:00:17.438
I've been drawing as a hobby for as long as I can remember

4
00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.947
and with that passion I wanted to pursue animation

5
00:00:19.948 --> 00:00:21.180
all throughout high school.

6
00:00:21.523 --> 00:00:24.483
Although in grade 12, I had a graphic design co-op,

7
00:00:24.484 --> 00:00:26.220
which then made me realize that graphic design

8
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:27.687
was a better fit for me and it was what I

9
00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:28.794
wanted to do in the future.

10
00:00:29:02 --> 00:00:32:07
So overall, what inspired me to pursue graphic design

11
00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:35.721
was my love for drawing and just my overall love for creating. 

12
00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:39.506
What is your dream company/studio to work with?]

13
00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:40.945
I've always been a huge fan of Disney.

14
00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:43.840
Their movies and shows have always been my favourite so,

15
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.889
if I could work with them in any way, shape, or form,

16
00:00:45.927  --> 00:00:47.180
it would be a dream come true.

17
00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:49.533
As for graphic design studios specifically,

18
00:00:49.54 --> 00:00:53.366
I would love to work with Doublenaut in Toronto or Cinnamon Toast here in Ottawa. 

19
00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:57.490
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

20
00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:00.806
My favourite class all throughout the graphic design program was motion graphics

21
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.623
because it was all new material and I learned a lot in that class.

22
00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:07.194
Also, it gave me a chance to do some animation, which was what I

23
00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:08.368
originally planned on doing so

24
00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.497
it was nice to have a taste of that area in design.

25
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.140
What is your favourite colour?]

26
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.076
My favourite color is yellow and it always has been

27
00:01:16.077 --> 00:01:18.345
for as long as I can remember. My favourite shades

28
00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:20.580
are the brighter yellows because they're so fun and happy. 

29
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.818
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

30
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.915
In my free time, I love to spend time with my family

31
00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:29.155
and something that we love to do together is go camping.

32
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:32.625
It's really nice to spend time outside and go for a bike ride or go to the beach.

33
00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:36.000
I've also started doing embroidery last year, which has been really fun

34
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:37.997
and it's been nice to learn something new.

35
00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:42.302
