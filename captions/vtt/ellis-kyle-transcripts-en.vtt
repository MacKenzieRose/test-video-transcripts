[Intro]

2
00:00:11.290  --> 00:00:19.090
Hello, my name is Kyle Ellis. I'm a third year graphic design student at Algonquin College, and today you're going to follow along to get to know me!

3
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.220
[What inspired you to pursue graphic design?]

4
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:33.150
The reason why I chose the graphic design program was because I was a special high-skills major in high school, specializing in information communication technology.

5
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.230
As a photography student, I decided I wanted to leverage up as an artist so I chose graphic design at Algonquin College.

6
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.060
[What is your favourite colour? Pantone or Hex?]

7
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.210
My favourite hex code colour would definitely have to be #0070BA. Take a look.

8
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.150
[What was your favourite class in the graphic design program?]

9
00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:02.020
So, my favourite class in the graphic design program would be graphic design with Angie, or computer graphics with Anish.

10
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.280
[What is your favourite Adobe application to work with?]

11
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.240
My favourite Adobe application would definitely have to be Photoshop given my photography background.

12
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.190
[What other passions and hobbies do you have aside from graphic design?]

13
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.260
So, my favourite activities and hobbies to do outside of the graphic design program definitely entail

14
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.040
photography, swimming, kayaking, dancing, listening to music, and bartending.

15
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.170
Thanks for watching this video. This is Kyle, have a wonderful day!
